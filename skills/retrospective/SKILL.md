# Retrospective Skill

Review the current session's use of WOS and submit structured feedback
to the WOS source repository via GitHub Issues.

## Workflow

Follow the steps in `references/retrospective-workflow.md`.

## Key Rules

- **Session-grounded.** Base observations on what actually happened in
  this session, not hypothetical scenarios.
- **User-driven.** The user decides what to include. Ask questions to
  prompt reflection, but don't invent observations.
- **Never submit without approval.** Show the full draft and get explicit
  confirmation before filing.
- **Target repo is hardcoded:** `bcbeidel/wos`
- **One issue per retrospective.** Don't split into multiple issues.
