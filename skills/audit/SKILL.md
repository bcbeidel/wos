# Audit Skill

Observe and report on project content quality. Read-only -- reports but
does not modify any files (unless `--fix` is used for index regeneration).

## How to Run

**Prerequisite:** Follow the preflight check in the [preflight reference](../_shared/references/preflight.md) before running.

```bash
# Default: run all checks including URL reachability
uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/audit.py --root .

# Skip URL reachability checks (fast, offline-friendly)
uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/audit.py --root . --no-urls

# Validate a single file
uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/audit.py path/to/file.md --root . --no-urls

# JSON output for programmatic use
uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/audit.py --root . --json

# Auto-fix out-of-sync or missing _index.md files
uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/audit.py --root . --fix

# Exit 1 on any issue (including warnings)
uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/audit.py --root . --strict

# Custom word count threshold for context files (default: 800)
uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/audit.py --root . --context-max-words 500
```

Exit code: 1 if any `fail`, 0 if only `warn`. Use `--strict` to exit 1 on any issue.

## The Checks

### 1. Frontmatter Validation (fail + warn)

Verifies:
- **fail:** `name` and `description` are non-empty
- **fail:** `type: research` documents have a non-empty `sources` list
- **warn:** Source items should be URL strings, not dicts
- **warn:** Context files should have `related` fields

### 2. Content Length (warn)

Warns when context files exceed 800 words (configurable via `--context-max-words`).
Artifacts and `_index.md` files are excluded.

### 3. Source URL Reachability (fail + warn)

Checks that every URL in `sources` is reachable via HTTP.
Skipped with `--no-urls`. URLs returning 403/429 are downgraded to
`warn` — these sites likely block automated checks, not dead links.

### 4. Related Path Validation (fail)

Checks that local file paths in `related` exist on disk.

### 5. Index Sync (fail + warn)

- **fail:** `_index.md` missing or out of sync
- **warn:** `_index.md` has no area description (preamble)

## Interpreting Results

Summary line first, then table:

```
2 fail, 1 warn across 15 files

file                              | sev  | issue
docs/context/api/auth.md           | fail | Frontmatter 'name' is empty
docs/context/api/_index.md        | warn | Index has no area description (preamble)
```

Exit code: 1 if any `fail`, 0 if only `warn`. Use `--strict` to exit 1 on any issue.

With `--json`, output is a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "docs/context/area/topic.md",
    "issue": "Frontmatter 'name' is empty",
    "severity": "fail"
  }
]
```

A clean project produces:

```
All checks passed.
```

## Cleanup Actions

After presenting audit results, offer to help resolve actionable warnings:

- **Missing AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md:** Offer to run `/wos:create` to
  initialize. Confirm with the user before writing any files.
- **AGENTS.md missing WOS markers:** Offer to run `/wos:create` to add
  the WOS-managed section. Confirm before modifying existing content.
- **CLAUDE.md missing @AGENTS.md reference:** Offer to add the reference.
  Do not rewrite CLAUDE.md contents — only add the `@AGENTS.md` line.
- **403/429 URL warnings:** Present each blocked URL to the user and ask
  them to verify it manually. For each URL:
  1. Show the URL and the file it appears in
  2. Ask the user to verify the URL. Offer these options:
     - **Visit in browser** and confirm it's still valid
     - **Provide a screenshot** of the page (drag/paste image)
     - **Provide a printed PDF** of the page (drag/paste file)
     - **Paste the page content** or a relevant excerpt
     - **Mark as dead** if the URL no longer works
  3. Based on response:
     - User confirms valid or provides content → no source change needed.
       If the user provided a screenshot, PDF, or pasted content, use it
       to verify the source is still relevant to the document. Note any
       discrepancies.
     - User says dead → offer to remove it from the document's `sources:`
       list. Show the proposed edit and get approval before writing.
     - User provides a replacement URL → offer to update the `sources:`
       entry. Verify the new URL with `uv run <plugin-scripts-dir>/check_url.py URL`
       before writing.

  Process URLs one at a time. Do not batch-ask about all URLs at once.

## Key Rules

- Audit is read-only (except `--fix` which only regenerates `_index.md` files)
- Use `/wos:create` to create missing documents
- Empty project (no `docs/` directory) exits 0 with no issues
