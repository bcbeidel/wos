# Distill

Convert research artifacts into focused context files.

## Execution Mode

The mapper always delegates (read-only, output goes to user approval).
The worker is conditional based on mapping size:

| Stage | Default | Override |
|-------|---------|---------|
| distill-mapper | delegate | — (always delegate: read-only, user approval gate) |
| distill-worker | conditional | inline for small mappings (1-3 context files); delegate for large mappings (>3 files) |

**Rationale:** For small mappings, the mapper's context carries useful
understanding of the research material that benefits the worker. For large
mappings, the write volume benefits from a fresh context focused solely on
the approved mapping.

**Inline worker execution:** Read the distillation-guidelines reference
file (per MANIFEST.md), then write context files directly in-thread
following the methodology. Run reindex + audit afterward, same as the
delegated agent would.

## Workflow

The skill executes two stages sequentially (inline or delegated). All
dispatch is foreground (no-nesting constraint).

### Step 1: Input

Accept a research artifact path from the user. If none provided, scan
`docs/research/` for the most recently modified `.md` file and confirm.

### Step 2: Compose and Dispatch Mapper

Read the mapper stage's reference files (per MANIFEST.md: mapping-guide.md,
distillation-guidelines.md). Compose the dispatch prompt: role from
MANIFEST.md, input (research document paths, target area root, user
constraints), methodology from reference files, output contract and
constraints from mapping-guide.md. Dispatch with tools: Read, Glob, Grep
(per MANIFEST.md). The mapper returns a proposed finding-to-context-file
mapping table.

### Step 3: Mapping Approval

Present the mapping table to the user. User approves, edits, or rejects
individual rows.

**Target location** depends on the project's layout hint (read from
AGENTS.md `<!-- wos:layout: ... -->` comment):
- **separated**: `docs/context/<area>/`
- **co-located**: same directory as the source research document
- **flat**: `docs/`
- **none** or missing: ask the user where to save
- User can always override the suggested location.

If rejected, re-compose and dispatch the mapper with the user's
feedback. Do not proceed without approval.

### Step 4: Execute Worker

Consult the Execution Mode section to decide inline vs delegate:

- **Inline** (1-3 context files): Read the distillation-guidelines
  reference, then write context files directly. Run reindex + audit.
- **Delegate** (>3 context files): Read the worker stage's reference
  files (per MANIFEST.md: distillation-guidelines.md). Compose the
  dispatch prompt (role + input + methodology + output + constraints).
  Dispatch with tools from MANIFEST.md. Pass the approved mapping
  (assigned findings, source research paths, target file paths,
  estimated word counts).

### Step 5: Completion

Present completion status to the user. Show which context files were
created, word counts, and any audit issues.

## Examples

<example>
**Distillation proposal table (Phase 3):**

| # | Finding | Target Area | Filename | Words (est.) |
|---|---------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Event loops use cooperative multitasking, not preemptive threading | docs/context/async/ | event-loop-model.context.md | ~350 |
| 2 | `asyncio.gather()` vs `TaskGroup` tradeoffs for concurrent I/O | docs/context/async/ | concurrency-patterns.context.md | ~400 |
| 3 | CPU-bound work blocks the event loop; use `run_in_executor()` | docs/context/async/ | cpu-bound-workarounds.context.md | ~250 |
</example>

<example>
**Distilled context file (Phase 4):**

```yaml
---
name: "Event Loop Model"
description: "How asyncio's single-threaded event loop achieves concurrency through cooperative multitasking"
type: context
sources:
  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html
related:
  - docs/research/2026-02-10-asyncio-deep-dive.research.md
  - docs/context/async/concurrency-patterns.context.md
---
```

Tasks yield control at `await` points, allowing other tasks to run on the
same thread. This differs from threading...
</example>

## Key Constraints

- **User controls granularity.** They pick which findings become standalone
  files vs. which get folded into existing files. Propose, don't decide.
- **Context files target 200-800 words.** This is advisory. If a finding
  needs more space, note it and proceed.
- **Carry forward sources.** Each context file should trace back to the
  original evidence via `sources:` URLs.
- **Bidirectional linking.** New files link to research via `related:`.
  Research links to new files via `related:`. Ask before modifying.

## Anti-Pattern Guards

1. **Proceeding without mapping approval** — the mapper's output is a proposal, not a plan. Writing context files without explicit user approval of the mapping wastes work if the user has a different granularity in mind. The approval gate is non-negotiable.
2. **Merging multiple distinct findings into one file** — one concept per context file. If two findings share a theme but have different decision implications, they belong in separate files. A merged file forces the user to read everything to find the relevant part.
3. **Unidirectional linking** — when a new context file lists research in `related:`, the source research document must list the context file in return. A link in one direction only is a dead end for agents traversing from the other side.
4. **Distilling without sources** — context files must trace findings back to the original research document. A context file with no `related:` pointing to its source research cannot be validated or updated when the research is revised.
5. **Exceeding 800 words without noting it** — the target is 200–800 words. Going over is sometimes justified, but it must be noted and the user must decide whether to split. Silent oversized files become the context rot that degrades retrieval quality over time.

## Handoff

**Receives:** Path to one or more research artifacts in `docs/research/`
**Produces:** Focused context documents saved to `docs/context/`
**Chainable to:** ingest, plan-work
