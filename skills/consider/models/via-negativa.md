description: Improve by removing problems rather than adding solutions
argument-hint: "[system, process, or situation to improve]"
---

<objective>
Instead of asking "what should we add?", ask "what should we remove?"
Often the fastest path to improvement is eliminating what's harmful,
unnecessary, or creating friction. Subtraction before addition.
</objective>

<process>
1. Describe the current state of the system or situation
2. List everything currently present (features, steps, dependencies, rules)
3. For each element, ask: "Would things improve if this were removed?"
4. Identify the top 3-5 candidates for removal
5. For each candidate, assess: What breaks if we remove it? What improves?
6. Propose the removal plan (what to cut, in what order)
7. Check: does the simplified version still achieve the core purpose?
</process>

## Via Negativa Analysis: [Topic]

### Current State
[Brief description of what exists today]

### Removal Candidates
| Element | Remove? | What improves | What breaks |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| [Item] | Yes/No | ... | ... |

### Recommended Removals
1. [What to remove and why]
2. ...

### Simplified Version
[What remains after removals — does it still serve the core purpose?]

### What NOT to Remove
[Elements that seem removable but are load-bearing]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Current state inventoried before proposing removals
- At least 5 elements evaluated for removal
- Each removal candidate assessed for both upside and downside
- At least one "looks removable but isn't" identified
- Simplified version explicitly checked against core purpose
</success_criteria>
