description: Identify the single highest-leverage action that makes everything else easier
argument-hint: "[goal or area where focus is needed]"
---

<objective>
Cut through complexity to find the one action that, if done, would make
everything else easier or unnecessary. Based on the focusing question:
"What's the ONE thing I can do, such that by doing it, everything else
becomes easier or unnecessary?"
</objective>

<process>
1. State the goal or area of focus
2. List all possible actions that could advance this goal
3. For each action, assess: does this make other actions easier or unnecessary?
4. Identify domino effects — which action unlocks the most subsequent progress?
5. Test the candidate: if ONLY this one thing gets done, was it worthwhile?
6. Define what "done" looks like for this one thing
7. Identify what to say "no" to in order to protect focus on the one thing
</process>

## One Thing Analysis: [Topic]

### Goal
[What we're trying to achieve]

### Candidate Actions
| Action | Domino Effect | Makes others easier? |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| [Action 1] | [What it unlocks] | Yes/Partially/No |
| [Action 2] | [What it unlocks] | Yes/Partially/No |

### The One Thing
[The single highest-leverage action]

### Definition of Done
[What completion looks like — specific and measurable]

### Say No To
[What to deprioritize to protect focus on the one thing]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- At least 4 candidate actions evaluated before selecting one
- Domino effects are specific (not "it helps everything")
- The one thing has clear causal connection to the broader goal
- Definition of done is concrete and verifiable
- "Say no to" list identifies real temptations, not straw men
</success_criteria>
