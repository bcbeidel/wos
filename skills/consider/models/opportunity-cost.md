description: Evaluate what you give up by choosing one option over alternatives
argument-hint: "[decision with multiple options to compare]"
---

<objective>
Make the hidden cost of every choice explicit. When you choose option A,
the real cost isn't just what A costs — it's the best alternative you gave
up. Prevents tunnel vision on the chosen path.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the decision and the option currently favored
2. List all viable alternatives (including "do nothing")
3. For each alternative, estimate the value it would provide
4. Identify the best alternative — this is the opportunity cost
5. Compare: does the favored option exceed its opportunity cost?
6. Check for hidden costs not captured in the direct comparison
7. State the decision with opportunity cost made explicit
</process>

## Opportunity Cost Analysis: [Topic]

### Decision
[What's being decided]

### Options
| Option | Direct Value | Direct Cost | Key Tradeoff |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| A (favored) | ... | ... | ... |
| B | ... | ... | ... |
| Do nothing | ... | ... | ... |

### Opportunity Cost
[Best alternative foregone and its estimated value]

### Hidden Costs
- [Cost not captured in direct comparison]

### Verdict
[Does the favored option justify its opportunity cost?]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- At least 3 alternatives listed (including "do nothing")
- Value estimates are specific, not vague hand-waving
- Opportunity cost is explicitly named as the best foregone alternative
- Hidden costs go beyond the obvious direct comparison
- Verdict directly addresses whether opportunity cost is justified
</success_criteria>
