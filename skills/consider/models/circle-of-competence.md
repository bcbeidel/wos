description: Scope decisions by distinguishing what you know well from what you don't
argument-hint: "[domain or decision where expertise boundaries matter]"
---

<objective>
Map the boundary between what you genuinely understand and what you only
think you understand. Make better decisions by staying within your circle
where possible, and explicitly flagging when you're operating outside it.
</objective>

<process>
1. Define the decision or domain being evaluated
2. List what you know well from direct experience (inside the circle)
3. List what you know about from reading but haven't practiced (the edge)
4. List what you don't know or are guessing about (outside the circle)
5. For the decision at hand, which zones does it require knowledge from?
6. For areas outside your circle, identify who has that competence
7. Decide: stay in circle, expand the circle, or bring in expertise
</process>

<output_format>
## Circle of Competence: [Topic]

### Domain
[The decision or area being evaluated]

### Inside (know well)
- [Area of genuine expertise — from direct experience]

### Edge (familiar but not deep)
- [Area where you have knowledge but not mastery]

### Outside (don't know)
- [Area where you're guessing or relying on assumptions]

### Decision Requirements
[Which zones does this decision touch?]

### Strategy
[Stay inside / expand the circle / bring in outside expertise]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Honest self-assessment (not inflating what's "inside")
- At least 2 items in each zone (inside, edge, outside)
- Decision requirements clearly mapped to knowledge zones
- Strategy acknowledges gaps rather than hand-waving them away
- Specific people, resources, or experts identified for outside zones
</success_criteria>
