description: Break down assumptions and rebuild reasoning from fundamental truths
argument-hint: "[problem or system to deconstruct]"
---

<objective>
Deconstruct a problem into its most basic, foundational elements. Strip away
assumptions, conventions, and analogies. Rebuild understanding from verified
fundamentals to find novel solutions.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the problem or system clearly in one sentence
2. List every assumption embedded in the current approach
3. Challenge each assumption — is it a fundamental truth or a convention?
4. Identify the bedrock truths that remain after challenges
5. Rebuild a solution from only those verified fundamentals
6. Compare the rebuilt solution to the conventional approach
7. Identify what the conventional approach gets wrong or misses
</process>

## First-Principles Analysis: [Topic]

### Problem Statement
[One clear sentence]

### Assumptions Identified
- [Assumption 1] — fundamental / convention / unverified
- [Assumption 2] — ...

### Fundamental Truths
1. [Verified truth that survived challenge]
2. ...

### Rebuilt Reasoning
[Solution constructed from fundamentals only]

### Key Insight
[What changes when you reason from fundamentals vs convention]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- At least 3 assumptions identified and explicitly challenged
- Each assumption classified as fundamental, convention, or unverified
- Rebuilt solution differs meaningfully from conventional approach
- Key insight is specific and actionable, not generic
- Analysis grounded in the specific topic, not abstract principles
</success_criteria>
