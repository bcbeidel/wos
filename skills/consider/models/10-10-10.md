description: Evaluate decisions by considering impact across three time horizons
argument-hint: "[decision you're weighing or struggling with]"
---

<objective>
Break through short-term emotional reactions by evaluating how a decision
will feel and matter at three time scales: 10 minutes, 10 months, and
10 years from now. Separates fleeting discomfort from lasting impact.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the decision clearly, including the options
2. For each option, assess: How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
3. For each option, assess: How will this matter in 10 months?
4. For each option, assess: How will this matter in 10 years?
5. Identify where short-term and long-term assessments diverge
6. Determine which time horizon should carry the most weight
7. Make the decision that optimizes for the right time horizon
</process>

## 10-10-10 Analysis: [Topic]

### Decision
[What's being decided, including options]

### Time Horizon Assessment
| Option | 10 Minutes | 10 Months | 10 Years |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| A | [feeling/impact] | [feeling/impact] | [feeling/impact] |
| B | [feeling/impact] | [feeling/impact] | [feeling/impact] |

### Divergence Points
[Where short-term and long-term assessments conflict]

### Dominant Time Horizon
[Which time frame matters most for this decision, and why]

### Decision
[The choice, justified by the appropriate time horizon]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>

- 10-minute assessment captures emotional/visceral reaction
- 10-month assessment captures practical, medium-term consequences
- 10-year assessment captures values alignment and lasting impact
- Decision explicitly states which time horizon dominated and why
</success_criteria>
