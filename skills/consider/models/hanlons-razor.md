description: Interpret behavior charitably — attribute to mistakes before malice
argument-hint: "[situation where someone's behavior seems problematic]"
---

<objective>
When faced with behavior that seems hostile, incompetent, or deliberately
harmful, consider simpler explanations first. Most apparent malice is
actually miscommunication, different priorities, lack of context, or honest
mistakes. Prevents adversarial framing from poisoning collaboration.
</objective>

<process>
1. Describe the behavior or situation that seems problematic
2. State the uncharitable interpretation (the "malice" reading)
3. Generate 3+ charitable alternative explanations
4. For each alternative, assess: is this plausible given available evidence?
5. Identify what information would distinguish between interpretations
6. Choose the most likely explanation given available evidence
7. Define the appropriate response based on the chosen interpretation
</process>

## Hanlon's Razor: [Topic]

### Situation
[The behavior or event that seems problematic]

### Uncharitable Interpretation
[The "malice" or "incompetence" reading]

### Charitable Alternatives
1. [Alternative explanation] — plausibility: high/medium/low
2. [Alternative explanation] — plausibility: high/medium/low
3. [Alternative explanation] — plausibility: high/medium/low

### Distinguishing Evidence
[What would you need to know to determine which interpretation is correct?]

### Most Likely Explanation
[The interpretation best supported by available evidence]

### Appropriate Response
[How to respond given the most likely explanation]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Uncharitable interpretation is stated explicitly (not dodged)
- At least 3 charitable alternatives generated
- Alternatives are genuinely plausible, not straw men
- Distinguishing evidence is concrete and obtainable
- Response is calibrated to the most likely explanation, not the worst case
</success_criteria>
