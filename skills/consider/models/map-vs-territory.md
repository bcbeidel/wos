description: Recognize where your mental model diverges from reality
argument-hint: "[situation where assumptions may not match reality]"
---

<objective>
Every mental model, plan, or abstraction is a map — a simplified
representation. The territory is reality. Identify where your map
diverges from the territory, what it leaves out, and where those
gaps could cause problems.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the mental model, plan, or abstraction being used
2. List what the model captures well (where map matches territory)
3. List what the model simplifies or abstracts away
4. List what the model ignores entirely
5. For each simplification and omission, assess: could this matter?
6. Identify the highest-risk gap between map and territory
7. Propose a way to verify the map against actual territory
</process>

## Map vs Territory: [Topic]

### The Map (current model)
[The mental model, plan, or abstraction in use]

### Where Map Matches Territory
- [Aspect that the model captures accurately]

### Where Map Simplifies
- [Aspect that's simplified] — risk: high/medium/low

### Where Map Is Blank
- [Aspect the model ignores entirely] — risk: high/medium/low

### Highest-Risk Gap
[The divergence most likely to cause problems]

### Reality Check
[How to verify the map against actual conditions]

<success_criteria>
- The model/abstraction is stated explicitly (not vague)
- Simplifications are specific, not just "it's simplified"
- At least 2 items in each category (matches, simplifies, blank)
- Risk assessments distinguish between dangerous and benign gaps
- Reality check proposes a concrete, executable verification step
