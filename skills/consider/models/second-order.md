description: Think through the consequences of consequences before acting
argument-hint: "[decision or action to evaluate]"

<objective>
Go beyond immediate effects to trace second and third-order consequences.
Most people stop at "what happens next?" — this model asks "and then what?"
repeatedly to uncover hidden costs, feedback loops, and unintended effects.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the proposed action or decision
2. List all immediate (first-order) effects
3. For each first-order effect, ask "and then what?" — list second-order effects
4. For significant second-order effects, push to third-order
5. Identify feedback loops (where effects amplify or dampen themselves)
6. Map unintended consequences that only appear at higher orders
7. Reassess the original decision with full consequence chain visible
</process>

## Second-Order Analysis: [Topic]

### Proposed Action
[The decision being evaluated]

### Consequence Chain
- **1st order:** [Immediate effect]
  - **2nd order:** [Consequence of that effect]
    - **3rd order:** [Consequence of the consequence]

### Feedback Loops
- [Loop description: A causes B which amplifies/dampens A]

### Unintended Consequences
- [Effect that only becomes visible at 2nd/3rd order]

### Revised Assessment
[Should we proceed, modify, or abandon given full consequence chain?]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- At least 3 first-order effects traced to second-order
- At least 1 third-order consequence identified
- Feedback loops explicitly identified (positive or negative)
- Unintended consequences are non-obvious (not restating first-order effects)
- Revised assessment shows the analysis changed or deepened the evaluation
</success_criteria>
