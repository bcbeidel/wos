description: Drill to root cause by asking why repeatedly until fundamentals emerge
argument-hint: "[problem or symptom to trace to its root cause]"
---

<objective>
Move past symptoms to find the root cause of a problem. Each "why" peels
back a layer of causation. Usually 5 iterations reach the systemic cause
that, if addressed, prevents recurrence.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the problem or symptom clearly
2. Ask "Why does this happen?" — record the answer
3. Take that answer and ask "Why?" again
4. Repeat until you reach a root cause (typically 5 levels)
5. Verify: does addressing the root cause prevent the original symptom?
6. Check for multiple causal chains (problems often have more than one root)
7. Identify the most actionable root cause to address first
</process>

## 5 Whys Analysis: [Topic]

### Problem Statement
[The symptom or issue observed]

### Why Chain
1. Why? [Answer 1]
2. Why? [Answer 2]
3. Why? [Answer 3]
4. Why? [Answer 4]
5. Why? [Root cause]

### Root Cause
[The fundamental issue identified]

### Verification
[Would fixing this root cause prevent the original problem?]

### Action
[Specific step to address the root cause]

<success_criteria>
- Problem statement describes a specific, observable symptom
- Each "why" answer is causal (not just restating the previous level)
- Chain reaches a systemic or structural root cause, not just blame
- Root cause is verified against the original problem
- Recommended action targets the root cause, not a symptom
</success_criteria>
