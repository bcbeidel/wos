description: Apply the 80/20 rule to find the highest-leverage inputs
argument-hint: "[area where effort and results feel misaligned]"
---

<objective>
Identify the vital few inputs that drive the majority of results. In most
systems, roughly 20% of causes produce 80% of effects. Find that 20% and
focus there for maximum leverage.
</objective>

<process>
1. Define the desired outcome or metric to optimize
2. List all inputs, activities, or factors that contribute to the outcome
3. Estimate each input's contribution to the total result
4. Rank inputs by contribution (highest first)
5. Identify the ~20% of inputs producing ~80% of results
6. For each high-leverage input, ask: can we do more of this?
7. For each low-leverage input, ask: can we reduce or eliminate this?
</process>

## Pareto Analysis: [Topic]

### Outcome to Optimize
[What we're trying to maximize or minimize]

### Input-to-Outcome Mapping
| Input | Est. Contribution | Cumulative |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| [Top input] | X% | X% |
| [Next] | Y% | X+Y% |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Vital Few (the 20%)
- [High-leverage input 1]: amplify by [specific action]
- [High-leverage input 2]: amplify by [specific action]

### Trivial Many (candidates for reduction)
- [Low-leverage input]: reduce/eliminate because [reason]

### Recommended Focus Shift
[Where to redirect effort for maximum impact]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- Inputs are specific and enumerable, not vague categories
- Contribution estimates are grounded in evidence or reasoning
- Clear separation between vital few and trivial many
- Amplification strategies are concrete and actionable
- Focus shift recommendation is specific to the situation
</success_criteria>
