description: Find the simplest explanation or solution that accounts for all known facts
argument-hint: "[phenomenon or problem with multiple possible explanations]"
---

<objective>
Among competing explanations, identify the one that makes the fewest
assumptions while still accounting for all observed evidence. Prefer
simplicity, but not at the cost of explanatory power.
</objective>

<process>
1. State the phenomenon or problem requiring explanation
2. List all known facts and observations that must be explained
3. Generate 3-5 candidate explanations of varying complexity
4. For each candidate, count the assumptions required
5. Check each candidate against all known facts — does it account for everything?
6. Select the simplest explanation that fits all facts
7. Identify what new evidence would distinguish between candidates
</process>

### Observations to Explain
- [Fact 1]
- [Fact 2]

### Candidate Explanations
| Explanation | Assumptions | Fits all facts? |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| [Simple] | N | Yes/No |
| [Complex] | N | Yes/No |

### Simplest Sufficient Explanation
[The winner and why]

### Distinguishing Evidence
[What would confirm or rule out alternatives]
</output_format>

<success_criteria>
- All known facts explicitly listed before generating explanations
- At least 3 candidate explanations with different complexity levels
- Assumption count is specific, not vague
- Simplest explanation genuinely accounts for all listed facts
- Distinguishing evidence is concrete and obtainable
</success_criteria>
