# Build Subagent

Scaffold a new Claude Code custom subagent definition with correct
structure, least-privilege tool selection, and a complete handoff contract.
The output is a `.claude/agents/<name>.md` file — not code, not a plan.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the build-subagent skill to scaffold this agent."

## Workflow

### 1. Justify the Subagent

Before any intake, confirm a subagent is the right primitive. Full decision matrix: [primitive-routing.md](../_shared/references/primitive-routing.md).

A subagent is a full context fork — high cost, separate context window. Ask: "Before we build this, is a subagent the right choice here?"

A subagent is justified only when at least one holds:
- **Parallelism or scope** — task is genuinely isolated; context fork cost is justified by workstream size or parallel execution
- **Permission isolation** — task requires tool access or permissions the parent agent should not hold
- **Context pressure** — intermediate work (search results, large file reads) is large enough to degrade the parent's reasoning quality

If none apply, recommend a skill instead:

> "A skill may be more appropriate here — lower overhead, same-context execution, no fork required. Use `/wos:build-skill` instead?"

Do not proceed to intake until the user confirms a subagent is the right primitive.

### 2. Elicit Requirements

Gather four inputs, one at a time:

1. **Name** — slug form: lowercase, hyphen-separated, no spaces
   (e.g., `data-analyst`, `doc-reviewer`)
2. **Description** — one sentence used for routing. Prompt: "What problem
   does this agent solve, and when should Claude invoke it instead of a skill?"
3. **Primary capability** — what workflow does the agent execute, start to
   finish? What does it produce?
4. **Tool requirements** — what does the agent need to do its job?

### 3. Apply Least-Privilege

#### Tool selection — always

For each tool the user requests, verify: does the workflow *require* this
tool, or is it "nice to have"?

Propose the minimal justified set. For each exclusion, explain why:

> "`Write` isn't needed — this agent reads and reports, it doesn't modify files."

For tools not requested but clearly needed, suggest them and explain why:

> "You'll need `Read` to inspect files, but I don't see it in your list."

**Common over-permissioning traps:**
- `Bash` when only file reads are needed
- `Write`/`Edit` when the agent only produces reports
- `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` for internal-only workflows
- `Agent` listed in tools — subagents cannot spawn other subagents; the
  Agent tool is filtered out at the platform level. Listing it has no effect.

**`tools` allowlist vs `disallowedTools` denylist:**
Use `tools` when the agent needs only a small, specific set. Use
`disallowedTools` when the agent should inherit most tools but block
specific ones. If both are set, `disallowedTools` is applied first.

#### Advanced configuration — conditional

Do not present these as a menu. Surface each only when the described
workflow signals it:

**`permissionMode`** — raise only if the agent makes broad or irreversible
changes:
- `plan`: proposes changes for user approval before acting
- `acceptEdits`: accepts file edits without prompting (fully automated writes)
- Note: if the parent uses `bypassPermissions` or `auto` mode, this field is
  overridden — the subagent cannot restrict its own permissions below the
  parent's level.

**`maxTurns`** — raise only if the workflow is multi-step or recursive:
> "This workflow has several steps — add `maxTurns: N` as a safety net.
> Agents without a turn limit can loop indefinitely on unexpected input."

**`background`** — raise only if parallelism was cited as the justification
in Step 1:
> "Since parallelism is the reason for this subagent, `background: true`
> lets it run concurrently while the parent continues."

**`isolation: worktree`** — raise when the agent writes or modifies files AND
parallelism was cited in Step 1 (`background: true`), or when the agent
makes changes to versioned files that require a clean working copy:
> "Since this agent modifies files in parallel, `isolation: worktree` gives
> it a clean working copy to prevent write conflicts."

**`skills`** — raise only if the workflow implies needing project-specific
context or WOS procedures:
> "Parent session skills aren't inherited. If this agent needs [skill]
> procedures, list it explicitly in the `skills` field."

**Portability** — raise only if the user mentions Copilot, Cursor, or
cross-platform use:

| Platform | Compatibility | What transfers |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | Direct — reads `.claude/agents/` natively | All fields; unknown fields ignored |
| GitHub Copilot | Structural — move to `.github/agents/<name>.md` | `name`, `description`, Markdown body; Claude Code-specific fields stripped |
| Codex CLI | Format conversion required | Rebuild as TOML in `.codex/agents/` |
| Windsurf | Different primitive | Not applicable |

If Copilot compatibility is needed, avoid `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`,
`background`, `isolation`, `memory`, and `hooks`.

### 4. Check for Overlap

Scan for conflicts before drafting:

1. Read `.claude/agents/` — list existing agent definitions
2. Read `skills/` — list existing skills

If the proposed capability duplicates an existing skill or agent, flag it:

> "The `research` skill already covers this workflow. Would a subagent
> add parallelism or isolation that the skill can't provide?"

Present overlap findings and confirm with the user before proceeding.

### 5. Draft the Definition

Produce a `.claude/agents/<name>.md` draft using only the fields confirmed
in Steps 2 and 3. Start from the minimum and add only what applies:

```markdown
---
name: <slug>
description: <routing description — write as a routing rule, not a capability summary>
tools:
  - <Tool1>
  - <Tool2>
---

# <Display Name>

<2–3 sentence capability description: what this agent does, what it
produces, when to use it.>

## When to invoke

<Specific trigger conditions — name the problem, not just the action.
What makes this the right agent over a skill or inline execution?
Include 1-2 example requests that SHOULD route here.
Include at least one example that should NOT (routes to a skill instead).>

## Workflow

<Numbered steps describing the agent's execution pattern.
The final step must state an explicit completion condition:
what "done" looks like and what the agent returns to the parent.>

## Handoff

**Receives:** <specific inputs from parent — name the data, not the category>
**Produces:** <specific outputs returned to parent — format, location, or structure>
**Returns to:** <parent agent or orchestrator>
```

Add fields only when they were raised and confirmed in Step 3:

| Field | Add when |
|---|---|
| `disallowedTools` | denylist approach was chosen over allowlist |
| `model` | specific model was justified for this workflow |
| `permissionMode` | agent makes broad or irreversible changes |
| `maxTurns` | multi-step or recursive workflow |
| `background` | parallelism was the Step 1 justification |
| `isolation: worktree` | agent writes files AND `background: true`, or modifies versioned files requiring a clean working copy |
| `skills` | workflow needs project-specific procedures |

Do not include fields that were not discussed. Do not include commented-out
placeholders. The output file contains only what applies.

**Description quality checklist** — before presenting for approval, verify
the description covers:

- What the agent does (primary function)
- When to invoke it (specific trigger conditions, written as routing rules)
- When NOT to invoke it (at least one exclusion)
- What it returns (output format or location)
- "use proactively" — include this phrase if the agent should be invoked automatically without being asked

A one-liner with no exclusions and no output format is insufficient. A description that reads as a capability summary rather than a routing rule will produce unreliable auto-delegation. Keep the total description under 1,024 characters — descriptions exceeding this limit are silently truncated without warning.

**Skills are not inherited.** The parent session's active skills do not carry over to subagents. If the workflow requires project-specific procedures, list them explicitly in the `skills` field. If omitted, the subagent starts with no skill context beyond its own system prompt.

### 6. Present for Approval

Show the complete draft. Wait for explicit user confirmation before writing
any file. If the user requests changes, revise and re-present.

Do not write the file until approved.

### 7. Write the File

Write to `.claude/agents/<name>.md`. Confirm the path and that the file
was written.

## Key Instructions

- **Won't write the definition file until the user explicitly approves the draft** — Step 6 is a hard gate; no file is written before it passes
- **Won't proceed to intake if a skill would suffice** — Step 1 justification check is mandatory; redirect to `/wos:build-skill` if none of the three justification conditions hold

## Anti-Pattern Guards

- **Over-permissioning** — requesting tools "to be safe" without per-tool
  justification. Every tool must be required by the workflow description.
- **Under-permissioning** — missing tools the workflow actually requires
  (e.g., no `Read` for a file-analysis agent, no `Bash` for a code executor).
- **`Agent` tool listed in subagent tools** — subagents cannot spawn other
  subagents; the Agent tool is filtered out at the platform level. Listing it
  has no effect and misleads readers.
- **Vague description** — a description that reads as a capability summary
  rather than a routing rule will produce unreliable auto-delegation. Route
  ambiguity causes missed invocations and incorrect handoffs.
- **Relying on auto-delegation** — auto-delegation by description matching is
  documented but frequently unreliable in practice. Design workflows around
  explicit invocation (@-mention). Do not tell users their agent "will
  automatically run" — it may not.
- **Missing `maxTurns` on complex workflows** — agents with multi-step or
  recursive patterns and no turn limit can loop indefinitely on unexpected
  input. Add `maxTurns` as a safety net for any non-trivial workflow.
- **Skill duplication** — a subagent that replicates an existing skill with
  no parallelism, isolation, or permission benefit. Use a skill instead.
- **Missing completion condition** — a workflow with no explicit final step
  describing what "done" looks like. Agents without stopping conditions fail
  in production.
- **Missing handoff contract** — no `## Handoff` section means the agent
  cannot participate in skill-chain design or `check-skill-chain` verification.

## Handoff

**Receives:** Subagent name, description, primary capability, and initial
tool requirements from user
**Produces:** `.claude/agents/<name>.md` definition file with validated
frontmatter, capability description, when-to-invoke guidance, workflow with
completion condition, and handoff contract
**Chainable to:** check-subagent
