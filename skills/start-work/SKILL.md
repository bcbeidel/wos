  Use when you have an approved implementation plan to execute.
  Handles sequential execution, parallel subagent dispatch, progress

# Start Work

Execute approved implementation plans with lifecycle enforcement, progress
tracking, and multi-session resumption.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the start-work skill to implement this plan."

## Workflow

### 1. Load Plan

Run the entry script:

```bash
python <plugin-skills-dir>/start-work/scripts/plan_assess.py --file <path>
```

If no plan path was provided, use `--scan` mode to find executing plans:

```bash
python <plugin-skills-dir>/start-work/scripts/plan_assess.py --scan --root <project-root>
```

Read the plan file. Parse the JSON output for status, task state, file
boundaries, and readiness. Present a summary to the user:

> "Plan: **[name]** — [completed]/[total] tasks complete, status: [status]"

### 2. Approval Gate

Enforce status requirements before proceeding:

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `draft` | **Refuse.** "This plan hasn't been approved yet. Get approval first, then come back." |
| `approved` | **Proceed.** Update frontmatter to `status: executing`. |
| `executing` | **Resume.** Consult [multi-session resumption](references/multi-session-resumption.md) to find where to pick up. |
| `completed` | **Refuse.** "This plan is already finished." |
| `abandoned` | **Refuse.** "This plan was intentionally stopped." |
| missing | **Warn.** "No status field — treating as legacy plan." Proceed with caution. |

### 3. Branch Setup

Before executing tasks, ensure work happens on a feature branch.

1. Check if currently on the default branch (`main` or `master`).
2. If on default branch:
   - Derive a branch name from the plan filename: strip `docs/plans/` and
     the date prefix. E.g., `docs/plans/2026-03-11-skill-workflow.plan.md` →
     `skill-workflow`.
   - Present to user: "This plan should be implemented on a branch.
     Suggested: `<name>` — use this, or provide a different name?"
   - Wait for user confirmation.
   - Create and checkout the branch: `git checkout -b <name>`
   - Write the branch name to the plan's `branch:` frontmatter field.
3. If already on a feature branch:
   - Present to user: "Currently on branch `<name>` — use this for
     the plan?"
   - On confirmation, write the branch name to the plan's `branch:`
     field if not already set.

### 4. Choose Execution Mode

**Sequential** (default) — execute tasks in order.

**Parallel** (opt-in) — requires ALL of these conditions:
- 3+ pending tasks
- No file overlap (entry script's `overlapping_tasks` is empty)
- User explicitly opts in when asked

If the entry script reports `parallel_eligible: true`, present the option:

> "This plan has [N] independent tasks with no file overlap.
> Execute sequentially (default) or in parallel?"

If not eligible, state why and proceed sequentially. Consult
[parallel dispatch](references/parallel-dispatch.md) for the full protocol.

If the plan contains research→distill workstreams, execute using this phased pattern:
1. Invoke `/wiki:research` for each research task — the skill handles the full pipeline internally
2. Validate outputs: `python <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py --root . --no-urls`
3. Present research summaries to user and wait for approval
4. Invoke `/wiki:distill` with the approved research documents
5. Validate distill outputs and verify bidirectional links in `related:` frontmatter

### 5. Execute Tasks

For each pending task:

1. **Implement** the task as described in the plan
2. **Verify** — identify verification type and apply the matching protocol
   from the [execution guide](references/execution-guide.md):
   - **Automated:** Run the command, confirm expected output
   - **Structural:** Read files, confirm observable facts
   - **Reasoning:** Trace implementation against the plan's Goal/Approach
3. **Git commit** the implementation: `feat(plan): task N — title`
4. **Update checkbox** `- [ ]` → `- [x]` with the SHA from step 3:
   `- [x] Task N: title <!-- sha:abc1234 -->`
5. **Commit plan update** (or fold into the next task's implementation commit)

On failure, consult [recovery patterns](references/recovery-patterns.md).

### 6. Validate

When all tasks are checked, present to user: "All tasks complete. Ready
to invoke `/wos:check-work` to verify the plan succeeded — proceed?"

Wait for user confirmation before invoking the skill.

- **User confirms** — invoke `/wos:check-work`, which runs validation
  and handles the `status: completed` transition on success.
- **User declines** — update frontmatter to `status: completed` directly.
  The user accepts responsibility for skipping plan-level validation.

### 7. Finish

Present to user: "Validation passed. Ready to invoke `/wos:finish-work`
to integrate — proceed?"

Wait for user confirmation before invoking the skill.

## Key Instructions

- **Commit per task creates rollback boundaries.** Every completed task
  gets its own git commit. On failure, diff against the last passing
  commit SHA from the checkbox annotation.
- **Plan file is source of truth.** Checkbox state + commit SHAs are the
  execution record. Do not rely on conversation context for state.
- **Don't check boxes without proof.** Every `[x]` requires verification
  evidence — command output, structural check, or reasoning trace.
- **Intermediates go to disk.** Write discovered decisions, edge cases,
  and API findings to the plan file or a companion notes file. Context
  resets; files persist.
- **Execute the plan as written.** Don't add features, refactor adjacent
  code, or expand scope during execution. If the plan needs changes,
  pause and discuss with the user.

## Anti-Pattern Guards

1. **Checking boxes without a commit SHA** — `[x]` without `<!-- sha:abc1234 -->` is a lost-update anti-pattern. A new session cannot verify what was done or roll back to a known-good state. Every checkbox requires both verification evidence and a commit SHA.
2. **Skipping the approval gate** — executing draft plans wastes work
   on unapproved designs. Always check status first.
3. **Autonomous recovery beyond 2 retries** (3 total attempts) —
   escalate to user with evidence, not infinite loops.
4. **Modifying plan scope during execution** — if the plan needs
   changes, pause and discuss with the user.
5. **Relying on conversation context** — sessions end; plan files
   persist. Always read the plan file and git log to orient.
6. **Skipping per-task commits** — the commit after each task IS the checkpoint. Without it, a failure forces a full restart rather than a partial rollback. "I'll commit at the end" negates the rollback boundary that per-task commits create.

## Handoff

**Receives:** Plan file path (`.plan.md`) with `status: approved`
**Produces:** Implemented code and files per plan; plan tasks marked `[x]` with commit SHAs
**Chainable to:** check-work
