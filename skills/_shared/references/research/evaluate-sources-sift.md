# Phase 4: Evaluate Sources (SIFT)

Apply SIFT (Stop, Investigate, Find better, Trace) to each source:

1. **Stop** — Flag as "unverified" until remaining steps complete.
2. **Investigate** — Check domain authority, author credentials, publication
   reliability. Classify into tier (see Source Hierarchy below).
3. **Find better** — For key claims, search for higher-tier sources. If
   found, upgrade. Note claims with limited sourcing.
4. **Trace** — For critical claims, follow citation chains to primary
   source. Verify claim matches original context.

After evaluation: drop sources below T5, never cite T6.

## SIFT Intensity by Mode

| Mode | Stop | Investigate | Find Better | Trace |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| deep-dive | Always | Full | Full | Key claims |
| landscape | Always | Domain only | Top 3 claims | Skip |
| technical | Always | Full | Full | All claims |
| feasibility | Always | Domain only | Key claims | Skip |
| competitive | Always | Full | Key claims | Skip |
| options | Always | Full | Full | Key claims |
| historical | Always | Domain only | Key claims | Key claims |
| open-source | Always | Repo metrics | Key claims | Skip |

## Source Hierarchy (T1-T6)

- **T1 — Official docs:** Project documentation, standards bodies (W3C, IETF), original author writings
- **T2 — Institutional research:** University departments, think tanks, industry consortia (CNCF)
- **T3 — Peer-reviewed:** Journals, conference proceedings, published books by domain experts
- **T4 — Expert practitioners:** Recognized experts in their domain, core maintainer blogs, conference talks
- **T5 — Community content:** High-voted Stack Overflow, community blogs, forum consensus
- **T6 — AI-generated:** LLM outputs without primary source verification. Never cite as a source.

## Authority Annotation

Annotate tiers in the document body, not the frontmatter:

```
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html (T1: official docs)
- https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html (T4: expert practitioner)
```

## Red Flags

- No author or organization identified
- Circular sourcing — multiple sources citing the same unverified origin
- Outdated information relative to domain currency
- Conflict of interest — vendor-sponsored research about own product
- Survivorship bias — only success stories, no failures

### Phase Gate: Phase 4 → Phase 5

Sources table has Tier + Status columns for all remaining sources.
