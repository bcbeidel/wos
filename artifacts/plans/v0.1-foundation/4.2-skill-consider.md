# Build Consider Skill

## Objective

An `/wos:consider` skill exists with 16 mental model commands, each as an
independent markdown file. Each model is invocable as
`/wos:consider:{model-name}`, accepts optional arguments (defaults to current
discussion context), and produces structured analysis output.

Adding a new mental model requires only adding a new `.md` file — no routing
changes, no registration step. Claude Code discovers models automatically
from the `skills/consider/models/` directory.

## Context

- Skills architecture: `artifacts/research/v0.1-foundation/2026-02-17-skills-architecture-design.md` §3.3
- Pattern source: taches-cc-resources `consider:*` skills (12 models, ~45 lines each)
- Sources: Farnam Street, Charlie Munger, Kahneman, Shane Parrish
- Independent of other skills — no dependencies on document type models

## Steps

1. Research existing implementations: search for well-starred mental model
   tools, structured thinking frameworks, and Claude Code plugins using
   per-file skill patterns. Look at taches-cc-resources and similar repos
   for structure and content quality. Document findings and adapt patterns.

2. Create `skills/consider/SKILL.md` with skill description listing all
   available models and their one-line "when to use" descriptions

3. Port 12 existing models from taches pattern, adapting content for quality
   and sourcing (each ~45 lines, uniform structure):
   - `models/first-principles.md` — break down assumptions, rebuild from fundamentals
   - `models/occams-razor.md` — find simplest explanation that fits all facts
   - `models/inversion.md` — solve problems backwards, identify failure modes
   - `models/second-order.md` — think through consequences of consequences
   - `models/eisenhower-matrix.md` — prioritize by urgency x importance
   - `models/opportunity-cost.md` — analyze what you give up by choosing this option
   - `models/via-negativa.md` — improve by removing rather than adding
   - `models/pareto.md` — apply 80/20 rule to find leverage points
   - `models/5-whys.md` — drill to root cause by asking why repeatedly
   - `models/swot.md` — map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
   - `models/10-10-10.md` — evaluate decisions across three time horizons
   - `models/one-thing.md` — identify single highest-leverage action

4. Create 4 new models:
   - `models/circle-of-competence.md` — scope decisions, know what you don't know
   - `models/map-vs-territory.md` — recognize model limitations, check assumptions
   - `models/reversibility.md` — assess decision risk (one-way vs. two-way doors)
   - `models/hanlons-razor.md` — interpret behavior charitably, avoid conspiracy thinking

5. Each model file follows uniform structure:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: [Brief description]
   argument-hint: [What input the skill accepts]
   ---
   ```
   Sections: `<objective>`, `<process>` (5-7 numbered steps),
   `<output_format>` (structured template), `<success_criteria>` (4-5 bullets)

6. Verify each model: invoke on a test topic, confirm output follows the
   template structure, confirm process steps are actionable

## Verification

- `skills/consider/models/` contains exactly 16 `.md` files
- Each file has YAML frontmatter with `description` and `argument-hint`
- Each file has all 4 sections: objective, process, output_format, success_criteria
- Each file is under 60 lines (concise, actionable)
- `/wos:consider:first-principles` invoked on "how to design a caching system" produces
  structured output with fundamentals identified, assumptions challenged, and
  rebuilt reasoning
- `/wos:consider:inversion` invoked on "how to make our product successful" produces
  failure modes and avoidance strategies
- All 16 models follow identical structure (only content differs)
