# Build Report-Issue Skill

## Objective

An `/wos:report-issue` skill exists that lets users submit feedback, bug
reports, and feature ideas back to the work-os source repository. It gathers
context from the user's project, classifies the issue type, drafts a GitHub
issue with relevant details, and submits via `gh` CLI after user preview and
approval.

## Context

- Skills architecture: `artifacts/research/v0.1-foundation/2026-02-17-skills-architecture-design.md` §3.2
- Independent of other skills — no dependencies on document type models
- Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Linear workflow, no conditional routing
- Issues are filed against the hardcoded work-os source repo
- Version is read from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

## Steps

1. Research existing implementations: search for well-starred GitHub issue
   tools, bug reporting CLIs, and Claude Code plugins that interact with
   `gh`. Look at how other tools gather context, draft issues, and handle
   the preview-before-submit pattern. Document findings and adapt patterns.

2. Create `skills/report-issue/SKILL.md` with skill description,
   conversational triggers ("report a bug", "submit feedback", "request a
   feature", "file an issue"), linear routing to single workflow

3. Create `skills/report-issue/workflows/report-issue-submit.md`:
   - Phase 1: Gather — ask what happened, what was expected, what context
     is relevant. Collect error messages, file paths, reproduction steps
   - Phase 2: Classify — determine issue type (bug, feature, feedback) and
     suggest appropriate labels
   - Phase 3: Draft — compose GitHub issue with title, description, steps
     to reproduce (for bugs), use case (for features), relevant context
     (work-os version from plugin.json, project structure, document types
     involved)
   - Phase 4: Preview — show formatted issue to user for review and edits
   - Phase 5: Submit — run `gh issue create` with title, body, and labels
     against the work-os source repo. Show issue URL on success

4. Create `skills/report-issue/references/issue-templates.md`:
   - Bug report template (steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual, environment)
   - Feature request template (use case, proposed solution, alternatives)
   - General feedback template (context, observation, suggestion)

5. Verify `gh` availability: workflow checks for `gh auth status` before
   proceeding, suggests setup if not authenticated

## Verification

- `/wos:report-issue` with "I found a bug" triggers the submit workflow
- Draft issue includes work-os version (from plugin.json) and relevant context
- User sees formatted preview before submission
- `gh issue create` is only called after explicit user approval
- Missing `gh` CLI produces helpful setup instructions, not a crash
