# Synthesis to Skill Pair

## Goal

Take a single synthesis output from `ensemble-rules` — a markdown document with six sections (consensus rules, strong minority, divergences, omissions, **shared deterministic checks**, final rules file) — and produce a working skill pair that operationalizes it inside this toolkit:

- A shared **principles doc** that build-* and check-* both cite
- A **build-<X>** skill that authors new artifacts following the principles
- A **check-<X>** skill that audits existing artifacts against the principles using a three-tier architecture (deterministic scripts → LLM judgment → cross-entity conflict)
- A set of **Tier-1 scripts** derived directly from the synthesis' deterministic-checks section
- A **repair playbook** with one recipe per finding type

The synthesis' Section 5 (*Shared Deterministic Checks*) is the direct source for the Tier-1 script catalog. Every shared check becomes either an off-the-shelf tool invocation or a bash script; singleton checks are evaluated case-by-case.

## Inputs

1. **Path to a synthesis run directory** — produced by `ensemble-rules`; expects at minimum:
   - `synthesis.md` — six sections (Consensus Rules, Strong Minority Rules, Divergences, Notable Omissions, Shared Deterministic Checks, Final Rules File)
   - `coverage-llm.md` — LLM-clustered coverage matrix: rule × model with ✓ marks; **primary attribution source** for the tier filter
   - `coverage.md` — rapidfuzz-deterministic coverage matrix; **cross-check source** at borderlines where LLM clustering and rapidfuzz disagree
   - `meta.json` — includes the panel model list used for the run
2. **Topic name** — the singular noun the skill pair operates on (e.g., `rule`, `skill`, `hook`, `agent`, `prompt`, `eval`). Used to generate `build-<topic>` and `check-<topic>` skill names.
3. **Target plugin directory** — default `plugins/build/`. Skills land under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/`; the shared principles doc lands under `plugins/<plugin>/_shared/references/`.

## What's already decided (constraints — do not reopen)

- **Principles doc is positively framed from word one.** Do not draft with "Don't X" / "Never Y" as the primary mode. Reserve negative framing for cases where no clean positive counterpart exists.
- **No rule-type taxonomy.** Categories like directive/enforcement/procedural/style dissolve on contact. Focus on judgment-vs-deterministic-vs-structural as the real distinction.
- **Three tiers, fixed.** Tier-1 = deterministic scripts. Tier-2 = one locked-rubric LLM call per artifact evaluating all dimensions simultaneously. Tier-3 = cross-entity conflict detection. No trigger gates on Tier-2 — all dimensions run always; dimensions that don't apply return PASS silently.
- **No orphan principles.** Every principle in the doc maps to exactly one Tier-1 check, one Tier-2 dimension, or explicit author-time-only. Multiple principles may share a dimension when they describe the same failure mode — prefer collapsing over multiplying. A typical outcome is ~25–30 principles distilled into 7–10 Tier-2 dimensions.
- **Inclusion bar (cross-family corroboration AND deployment guarantee).** A candidate rule, dimension, or check enters the Core principles doc *only if*:
  1. **Cross-family support** — raised by at least 2 different model families (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / xAI) per `coverage-llm.md`, AND
  2. **Deployment guarantee** — either Haiku (or the panel's affordable-tier Anthropic model) raised it, *or* the check is mechanically deterministic (enforceable by a Tier-1 script or off-the-shelf tool without model judgment).

  Rules that meet (1) but fail (2) are **dropped**, not preserved in an Advanced section. The goal is a tight core that affordable-tier models (Sonnet-class and below) can execute. Rules failing (1) are also dropped. Discrepancies between `coverage-llm.md` and `coverage.md` at the borderline are noted in the principles doc's provenance footnote.
- **Scripts target bash-3.2-portable by default.** macOS compatibility. Use `/build:build-shell` in full human-mode for every script — not `--as-tool`. POSIX utilities only (no GNU-specific `\<\>` word boundaries, no `mapfile`, no associative arrays).
- **Scripts live at `plugins/<plugin>/skills/check-<X>/scripts/*.sh`.** Claude resolves absolute paths at invocation time; do not rely on `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (documented for hooks, not skills). Use a `${SKILL_DIR}` placeholder in SKILL.md and document the resolution convention.
- **Output lint format is fixed:** `SEVERITY  <path> — <check>: <detail>` on one line, followed by `  Recommendation: <specific change>` on the next. Severities: `FAIL`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `HINT`. Exit 0 on clean / WARN / INFO / HINT-only; exit 1 on FAIL; exit 64 on arg error; exit 69 on missing dependency.
- **Commit in vertical slices, one PR.** Each phase below that produces artifacts lands as its own commit. Self-review then human review before merge.
- **Skill-chain relationships are declared, not inferred.** Every `build-<X>` and `check-<X>` SKILL.md ends with a `## Handoff` section carrying `Receives:` / `Produces:` / `Chainable to:` fields. The default chain is bidirectional: `build-<X>` is chainable to `check-<X>` (audit the just-built artifact); `check-<X>` is chainable to `build-<X>` (rebuild after flagged repairs). Preserve any chain relationships the legacy skills declared — if the old `build-<X>` chained into another skill (e.g., `verify-work`, `finish-work`), that linkage carries over unless the ensemble or project docs explicitly deprecate it. Chain relationships are part of the project-fact content extracted in Phase 1.
- **Skill-spec is the anchor.** All SKILL.md outputs must conform to the documented Claude Code skill specification plus this toolkit's layered conventions (`references:` array, `argument-hint`, `user-invocable`, `## Handoff`, etc.). When any field, section name, or behavior is uncertain: (1) look up the current Anthropic skill docs — the spec evolves, don't rely on training-time knowledge; (2) compare against an existing, recently-reviewed toolkit skill in the same plugin as a structural reference; (3) surface the uncertainty to the user before proceeding. Do not invent frontmatter keys or section names to fit a mental model of what "feels" right — `check-rule`'s Tier-1 "frontmatter shape" check flags unknown top-level keys precisely because the spec is narrow, and Claude Code silently ignores keys it doesn't recognize.
- **Dogfood `/build:build-skill` and `/build:check-skill`.** The authoring and audit skills this prompt produces are the canonical way to write and validate Claude Code skills in this toolkit. Use them: Phase 4 authors both SKILL.md files via `/build:build-skill` (not ad-hoc drafting); Phases 5, 8, and 10 audit via `/build:check-skill` (not hand-rolled cross-checks). The meta-rule is that every skill pair this prompt produces must itself pass `/build:check-skill` with zero findings — the skills hold themselves accountable to the rubric they enforce. When those skills evolve, this prompt follows.

## What to produce (outputs)

| Artifact | Location |
|---|---|
| Principles doc | `plugins/<plugin>/_shared/references/<topic>s-best-practices.md` |
| Authoring skill | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/build-<X>/SKILL.md` |
| Audit skill | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/check-<X>/SKILL.md` |
| Audit rubric | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/check-<X>/references/audit-dimensions.md` |
| Repair playbook | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/check-<X>/references/repair-playbook.md` |
| Tier-1 scripts | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/check-<X>/scripts/*.sh` |
| Plugin version bump | `plugins/<plugin>/pyproject.toml` + `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` |

## Workflow

Each phase ends with an approval gate unless marked otherwise. Do not proceed without approval.

### Phase 0a: Panel classification

Read `meta.json` and tag each model by `{family, tier}`. Families: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI. Tiers: frontier, affordable.

Produce a table:

| Model | Family | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| openai/gpt-5 | OpenAI | frontier |
| openai/gpt-4o-mini | OpenAI | affordable |
| anthropic/claude-opus-4-7 | Anthropic | frontier |
| anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 | Anthropic | affordable |
| … | … | … |

If an unknown model appears, halt and ask for classification rather than guessing. Flag families that have only frontier representation or only affordable representation — the inclusion bar can still apply, but note the gap in the principles doc provenance footnote ("Google is represented by Gemini Pro only; affordable-tier Google coverage was not verifiable").

The affordable-tier Anthropic model ("Haiku in the default panel) is the **deployment-guarantee proxy** — if it raised a rule, Sonnet-class and above can apply the rule.

### Phase 0b: Rule classification (Core / Drop)

For every candidate rule, dimension, or check from synthesis Sections 1, 2, and 5:

1. Read the attribution from `coverage-llm.md` — which models raised this rule?
2. Count distinct **families** that raised it (≥2 required for Core).
3. Check if the affordable-tier Anthropic model (Haiku) is among them.
4. If Haiku is not among them, determine whether the check is **mechanically deterministic**: enforceable by regex, AST traversal, a file-format parse, or an off-the-shelf tool (`shellcheck`, `gitleaks`, `markdownlint`) without model judgment.
5. Cross-check against `coverage.md`: if rapidfuzz attributes fewer families than LLM clustering, treat the rule as lower-confidence (still Core if both criteria hold, but note the discrepancy).

Classify:

| | Haiku raised | Haiku silent |
|---|---|---|
| **Cross-family (≥2) AND deterministic** | **Core** | **Core** |
| **Cross-family (≥2) AND judgment-only** | **Core** | **Drop** |
| **Single-family (1)** | **Drop** | **Drop** |

Produce a classification table and flag any clustering discrepancies between the two coverage sources.

**Approval gate** — the classification determines what lands in the principles doc. Do not proceed without sign-off. Expect roughly half of candidates to drop; that is the filter working.

### Phase 0c: Foundation — principles doc

Consuming **only Core-classified** items from Phase 0b, produce `<topic>s-best-practices.md` with these sections in order:

1. **What a Good <X> Does** — one-paragraph scope statement
2. **Anatomy** — the file/structure template the skills will both reference
3. **Authoring Principles** — Core principles from Phase 0b, each one paragraph. Include the *why* alongside each.
4. **Patterns That Work** — the same principles reframed as positive shapes ("X over Y"). Each corresponds to a failure mode Tier-2 audits.
5. **Safety** — Core safety rules. Name what's auditable deterministically vs. what relies on author judgment.
6. **Review and Decay** — retirement triggers, cadence
7. A closing diagnostic paragraph
8. **Provenance footnote** — one short paragraph naming the ensemble run, the panel, the inclusion bar (cross-family + Haiku-or-deterministic), and any clustering discrepancies flagged in Phase 0b.

Constraints:
- Target ~800–1500 words. The worked example `rules-best-practices.md` runs ~1,500 words; treat that as the ceiling and aim for concise within it. Going below 400 usually means you compressed out the *why*.
- Positive framing throughout. Negative framing only where no clean positive counterpart exists.
- No concrete numeric thresholds (those live in check-<X>'s Tier-1, not principles).
- No rule-type taxonomy.
- Do **not** include an "Advanced" section. Rules that failed the inclusion bar are dropped. If you believe a dropped rule is load-bearing, raise it in the approval conversation — do not silently include it.
- **Cross-check any section list against ≥2 peer skills in the target plugin before locking.** If the principles doc prescribes canonical body sections (e.g., `## When to use / ## Prerequisites / ## Steps / ## Failure modes / ## Examples`), those section names become Tier-1 structural checks in Phase 3 — any peer skill that uses a different convention (`## Workflow / ## Key Instructions / ## Handoff`) will fail that check. Either (a) align the principles doc with the lived convention, or (b) extend the required-sections list to include both the ensemble-prescribed and the toolkit-lived sections. Do not prescribe sections that the plugin's existing meta-skills don't use without a deliberate migration plan.
- **Provenance footnote is optional.** The ensemble run directory is on disk and reproducible; the prompt doesn't need to duplicate its contents. When you include one, keep it to a single short paragraph naming the run date, panel, and inclusion bar. Skip it by default; add on request.

**Approval gate.** Present the draft. Iterate on feedback. Do not proceed to Phase 1 without explicit approval.

### Phase 1: Legacy extraction (skip if greenfield)

If the plugin already has an existing `build-<X>` / `check-<X>` pair, **the ensemble is the source of truth for principles; legacy content is discarded without per-opinion review.** The inclusion bar in Phase 0b is the filter — legacy principles, patterns, dimensions, or repair recipes that aren't reaffirmed by the ensemble are dropped.

The **only** thing to preserve from the legacy skill is **project-fact content** — things the ensemble cannot know because they're specific to this toolkit's local ecosystem. Extract these in a brief one-pass scan:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Tool mechanics | "Claude Code loads rules from `.claude/rules/*.md`"; "hook scripts receive `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`" |
| Path conventions | "Plugins live at `plugins/<name>/`"; "skills at `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`"; "shared references at `plugins/<plugin>/_shared/references/`" |
| Output conventions | Lint format `SEVERITY  <path> — <check>: <detail>`; exit-code contract; severity naming |
| **Section / body-shape conventions** | "Meta-skills in this toolkit use `## Workflow / ## Key Instructions / ## Anti-Pattern Guards / ## Handoff`"; required-section lists that peer skills actually use. If the lived convention diverges from the ensemble's prescribed shape, flag the gap here — Phase 0c will reconcile. |
| Test conventions | `tmp_path` fixtures; stdlib-only; inline markdown strings |
| Version/release conventions | `pyproject.toml` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` bump pattern |
| **Skill-chain relationships** | "`build-<X>` chained to `check-<X>`"; any third-party chain targets (e.g., "`build-rule` → `check-rule` → `verify-work`"); custom `Receives:` / `Produces:` contracts beyond the default |
| **Legacy code dependencies** | For rescaffolds: imports, side-effect registrations, and test modules backing the legacy skill (e.g., "`check.skill` registers `SkillDocument` via `check/__init__.py`"; "`tests/test_skill_audit.py` covers the module"). Needed so Phase 4's delete step doesn't leave orphan code or broken imports. |

Produce a short artifact at a tracked location — `plans/<date>-legacy-facts-<topic>.md` is the default, but many toolkits gitignore `plans/` or `.plans/` as work-in-flight. If that's the case here, either (a) write the artifact to `docs/` or an equivalent tracked directory, or (b) inline the facts into the Phase 4 commit message or the final PR description. The goal is an audit trail reviewers can see, not a committed file specifically.

**Everything else in the legacy skill — principles, patterns, audit dimensions, repair recipes, anti-pattern guards, narrative prose — is discarded.** It either survives the ensemble inclusion bar in Phase 0b or it doesn't matter. No walkthrough, no per-opinion accept/modify/drop ceremony.

**Approval gate** — present the extracted facts list. A short list is the expected outcome; if the list gets long, you're probably preserving too much. Target ≤20 bullets.

### Phase 2: Principle → audit dimension mapping

Produce a table mapping each principle to exactly one Tier-2 audit dimension, one Tier-1 check, or explicit author-time-only.

| Principle | Dimension | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| … | … | 1/2/3/author-time | … |

Collapse overlapping principles (e.g., "positive framing" + "direct voice" → single "Framing" dimension). No orphans — every principle must be accounted for.

**Approval gate.**

### Phase 3: Script breakdown from Section 5

**Preliminary: existing-harness decision.** Before drafting the script catalog, surface and decide: does the legacy skill pair already have a code-backed audit harness (Python, Node, etc.)? If so, pick one:

1. **Greenfield bash** — reimplement every deterministic check as bash-3.2 scripts under `check-<X>/scripts/*.sh`. Default when the legacy harness is orphaned or small.
2. **Wrap the existing harness** — keep the Python (or other) module; write thin bash wrappers that invoke it and reformat output to the fixed lint format. Preserves test coverage and avoids reimplementation cost.
3. **Hybrid** — bash for checks with tractable POSIX implementations (filename, line count, regex); Python (wrapped by bash) for checks that need a real parser (YAML, Markdown AST). Matches the pattern peer skills like `check-rule` have evolved into.

Surface this as an explicit approval gate question before writing the breakdown. Whichever option, the entry point is a bash script under `check-<X>/scripts/` so the SKILL.md's orchestration block stays uniform.

Then read synthesis Section 5 (*Shared Deterministic Checks*) cross-referenced with `coverage-llm.md`. Apply the same inclusion bar as Phase 0b:

1. **Shared checks (≥2 families raised it).** Implement as Tier-1 script (deterministic-enforcement automatically satisfies the deployment-guarantee criterion). Group related checks into one script where the signal sources overlap (e.g., a single script for location + extension + frontmatter shape, since all read the file header).

2. **Singleton checks (one family only).** **Default: drop.** These fail the cross-family bar. Include only with an explicit justification ("this one-model check plugs a known gap other models missed"); the default is to skip.

3. **Off-the-shelf tools.** If the synthesis names a tool (`shellcheck`, `gitleaks`, `markdownlint`, etc.) and it covers the check adequately, wrap the tool (don't re-implement). A bash wrapper that invokes the tool and reformats output into the fixed lint format is the right move.

Produce a script breakdown table:

| Script | Source check(s) | Family count (LLM / rapidfuzz) | Tier-1 severity | Tool candidate |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Pre-filter scripts for Tier-2 dimensions (hedges / prohibitions / synthetic placeholders) are **optional** and only add them when the target Tier-2 dimension is a Core principle AND a cheap deterministic "obvious case" catcher exists. Pre-filters emit WARN only; they do not replace Tier-2, they accelerate it.

**Approval gate** — the breakdown is the design; scripts are mechanical after this. Do not write scripts without approval.

### Phase 4: Skill rescaffold (one commit)

Before writing any SKILL.md, confirm frontmatter fields against the current Claude Code skill spec (look it up — do not rely on training-time knowledge) and cross-check shape against a peer toolkit skill in the same plugin. Unknown fields are refused, not invented. If you encounter a field the spec doesn't document, surface it to the user before including it.

**Author both SKILL.md files via `/build:build-skill`** — do not hand-draft from a template. For each of `build-<X>` and `check-<X>`:

1. Invoke `/build:build-skill <name> <short intent phrase>` — keep the args string under ~300 characters. `argument-hint`-driven substitution inserts the full args into the loaded skill body four times inside Step 4's documentation; long intents degrade that step's readability for the rest of the workflow. Pass rich context (chain relationships, architecture summary, principles-doc path) in the post-intake interview, not the args.
2. Provide the principles doc and the peer skill reference during intake so `/build:build-skill`'s interview produces a shape consistent with the rubric. Skip any explicit pre-narration before invoking — `/build:build-skill`'s Step 6 narrates design choices itself, so a synthesis-prompt-side pre-narration duplicates work.
3. Accept the skill's approval gate before writing.
4. `/build:build-skill` will chain to `/build:check-skill` after writing — process its findings before moving on.

This is the dogfood point: the skills we author for others are the ones we use ourselves. If `/build:build-skill` can't produce a passing skill here, that's a bug in `/build:build-skill`, not a reason to hand-draft.

The four artifacts and their contents:

- `build-<X>/SKILL.md` — workflow (primitive check → intake → scope → conflict check → draft → approval gate → write), plus anti-pattern guards each citing a principle by name. Reference frontmatter points at the shared principles doc and `primitive-routing.md`. End with a `## Handoff` section: `Receives:` / `Produces:` / `Chainable to:` (minimally `check-<X>`; plus any chain relationships preserved from Phase 1's legacy-facts extraction).
- `check-<X>/SKILL.md` — three-tier workflow. Tier-1 section lists scripts (placeholder — scripts not yet written). Tier-2 lists all dimensions, always-on. Tier-3 describes cross-entity conflict detection. End with a `## Handoff` section: `Receives:` / `Produces:` / `Chainable to:` (minimally `build-<X>` to rebuild after repairs; plus any preserved chain relationships).
- `audit-dimensions.md` — Tier-1 check table + Tier-2 dimension descriptions. Each dimension cites its source principle by name from the shared doc. Author directly (not via `/build:build-skill`, which targets SKILL.md).
- `repair-playbook.md` — one recipe per Tier-1 finding type (including each subtype a script might emit) + one recipe per Tier-2 dimension failure + one per Tier-3 conflict. Each recipe: Signal → CHANGE → FROM → TO → REASON. Note at top that HINT output is feed-forward context, not a finding requiring repair. Author directly.

**Delete legacy files, including code dependencies.** Drawing on the Phase 1 legacy-facts extraction:

1. Delete legacy reference markdown whose content was absorbed.
2. Delete legacy code modules backing the legacy skill (e.g., `plugins/<plugin>/src/<pkg>/skill.py`).
3. Remove side-effect registrations (e.g., `import <pkg>.skill` lines in `__init__.py` that only exist to register a Document subclass).
4. Delete test modules that targeted the deleted code (`tests/test_<module>.py`).
5. Update any external wiring the legacy code had (e.g., `plugins/wiki/scripts/lint.py` imports, pyproject `include` directives) — verify no other module still imports the deleted code.

Bump the plugin version (minor for substantive rework).

**Before committing — two toolkit-specific watch-outs:**

- **AGENTS.md auto-region drift.** `build-skill`'s Step 7 runs `reindex.py`, which rewrites the `<!-- wiki:begin/end -->` region. Hand-curated content that drifted into the region gets stripped silently. After lint+reindex, run `git diff AGENTS.md` and verify no hand-curated sections (Plugin Structure tables, project-specific Preferences) disappeared. Restore outside the auto-region if so.
- **Pre-commit hook is tree-wide.** The toolkit's pre-commit hook runs `ruff check plugins/` against the entire tree, not just staged files. Any new Python file (including hybrid AST helpers from Phase 6) must pass ruff before the *first* commit lands, regardless of which slice that commit covers. Run `python3 -m ruff check plugins/ && python3 -m ruff format --check plugins/` before staging the first commit; finding ruff errors mid-commit-loop wastes a commit attempt.

**Commit and push.**

### Phase 5: First self-consistency audit

Before writing any scripts, cross-check the four artifacts.

**Run `/build:check-skill` against both SKILL.md files.** The scripts the audit references don't exist yet, so Tier-1 will skip the not-yet-written deterministic checks — that's expected. Tier-2 dimensions (which evaluate the SKILL.md body against the principles) still run and will flag the most common drift: capability-shaped descriptions, missing `## Handoff` fields, steps with embedded commentary, placeholder Examples. Process the findings before moving on.

Also do the manual cross-checks that `/build:check-skill` doesn't automate:

- Does every principle in the shared doc appear as a dimension in `audit-dimensions.md` (or is explicitly author-time-only)?
- Do dimension names match across SKILL.md, `audit-dimensions.md`, and `repair-playbook.md`?
- Do cross-reference paths (`../../_shared/references/...`) resolve?
- Does the `build-<X>` example produce a file that would pass all Tier-2 dimensions?
- Does the `check-<X>` example output use the correct severity names and the canonical `SEVERITY  <path> — <check>: <detail>` + `  Recommendation:` format?

Fix findings. **Do not skip this.** Fresh-eye audit finds things author bias misses.

**Commit fixes.**

### Phase 6: Write scripts via `/build-shell` (or reduced-ceremony when a peer exists)

Two paths, chosen based on whether a peer in-tree script reference exists:

**Full `/build-shell` ceremony** — for the first skill pair in a plugin, or when no similar scripts exist nearby. Invoke `/build:build-shell` in full human-mode for each script:

1. Route → Scope Gate → Elicit → Draft → Safety Check → Review Gate → Save

Elicit fields (pre-fill from the breakdown):
- target-shell: `bash-3.2-portable`
- purpose: one sentence
- invocation-style: `cli`
- setuid: `no`
- deps: comma-separated (prefer POSIX standards: `awk`, `find`, `basename`, `grep`, `tr`, `sed`, `head`)
- save-path: under `scripts/` in the check-<X> directory

**Reduced ceremony** — when a peer `check-<Y>/scripts/*.sh` exists in the same plugin (the skeleton is established, the lint format is canonical, the exit-code contract is universal). Copy a sibling's skeleton, adapt the check logic, smoke-test, commit in small vertical slices. Surface the reduced-ceremony option explicitly at the Phase 6 approval gate — the full `/build-shell` loop is overkill when you're matching an established pattern.

Either path, each script:
- Emits in the fixed lint format
- Exits per the fixed contract (0/1/64/69)
- Includes a top-of-file header with purpose, usage, exit codes, dependencies
- Has a `preflight` function that names missing deps + install hint
- Uses POSIX-only awk (no `\<\>` word boundaries — use `[^A-Za-z_]` groups)
- Follows the same shape as the other scripts in the directory (copy a sibling's skeleton)

**POSIX awk gotchas worth naming:**
- `exit 0` from a match block still runs the `END` block. A naïve `END { exit 1 }` overrides the found-case. Use `exit found ? 0 : 1` in END, not a bare `exit 1`.
- When a script's own text describes its regex (e.g., a script-to-check table that lists the hedging wordlist), the regex may self-match on the SKILL.md that documents it. Strip inline code spans (`` `...` ``) before matching, or scope the check to fenced blocks only, depending on the check's intent.

Smoke-test each script against a real fixture (`.md` for rule/skill skills; `.py` for Python-script skills; etc.) after writing. Verify the `-h` flag prints usage; verify exit 1 on fixture FAIL and exit 0 on clean.

**Hybrid-pattern ruff gate.** When the script set uses bash-entry + Python-AST-helper (per Phase 3's hybrid decision), run `python3 -m ruff check <helper>.py && python3 -m ruff format --check <helper>.py` before staging — the toolkit's tree-wide pre-commit hook will block the *first* commit otherwise. Long recommendation strings inside `emit()` calls are the most common E501 offender; wrap or shorten before committing.

**Commit scripts as one unit** (or a small number of vertical slices if the set is large — 2–3 scripts per commit is a natural grouping when the set is 5–7 scripts).

### Phase 7: Wire scripts into check-<X>/SKILL.md

Replace the placeholder Tier-1 section with concrete invocation:

```bash
SCRIPTS="${SKILL_DIR}/scripts"  # Claude resolves ${SKILL_DIR} from the skill's base directory
TARGETS="$ARGUMENTS"

bash "$SCRIPTS/<script-1>.sh"     $TARGETS
bash "$SCRIPTS/<script-2>.sh"     $TARGETS
...
```

Add a script-to-check map (table: script | checks | severity levels).

Add explicit orchestration rules:
- Which FAIL findings exclude from Tier-2 (usually: location, extension, secrets, glob syntax, oversize)
- Which findings do NOT exclude (WARN, INFO, HINT)
- How HINT lines feed the Tier-2 prompt as context

**Commit.**

### Phase 8: Second self-consistency audit

After scripts exist, re-audit.

**Re-run `/build:check-skill` against both SKILL.md files.** Now that the Tier-1 scripts exist, `/build:check-skill` runs the full deterministic suite. Expect to find: long lines from dense prose (`check_size.sh` WARN), body-shape drift between SKILL.md and the principles doc's required sections (`check_structure.sh` FAIL), any hedging words the first-pass author missed (`check_prose.sh` WARN).

Also do the manual cross-checks `/build:check-skill` doesn't automate:

- Every finding a script emits has a repair-playbook recipe (including each subtype — e.g., `check_paths_glob` emits four subtypes; the playbook should cover all four).
- Script severity column matches `audit-dimensions.md` severity column.
- Script exit-code contract matches SKILL.md orchestration rules.
- The `${SKILL_DIR}` pattern is documented; `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not used.
- Smoke-test each script against a real `.md` file; verify output parses cleanly.

Fix findings. The meta-rule applies: both SKILL.md files must pass `/build:check-skill` with zero Tier-1 FAILs before Phase 10. **Commit fixes.**

### Phase 9: Pre-filter scripts (optional)

If Phase 3 identified pre-filter candidates (obvious hedges for Specificity, prohibition openers for Framing, synthetic placeholders for Example Realism):

- Write one consolidated `check_prose.sh` via `/build-shell`
- All findings WARN severity
- Exit 0 always (heuristics, not failures)
- Wire into Tier-1 invocation
- Update audit-dimensions.md table

Skip this phase if Tier-2 is already cheap or if no obvious-case patterns emerged.

**Commit if used.**

### Phase 10: End-to-end validation (do not skip)

**Precondition: install any wrapped external tools.** When the audit skill wraps an external tool (`ruff`, `gitleaks`, `markdownlint`, `bandit`, `shellcheck`), e2e validation needs the tool installed locally to exercise the full-coverage path. The graceful-degradation branch (`tool-missing` INFO + exit 0) only confirms the absent-tool path. CI install commands are the source of truth for what to install — match them locally before running Phase 10. Skipping this means full deterministic coverage is only ever exercised in CI, where a regression is the worst place to discover it.

Create a small fixture — 3–5 files (use the artifact extension the skill audits: `.md` for rules/skills, `.py` for Python scripts, `.sh` for shell scripts, etc.) covering:
- One clean file that should pass all checks
- One with a deterministic FAIL (secret, bad glob, wrong location)
- One with a Tier-2-detectable problem (hedged language, prohibition-only)
- One with both

**Run `/build:check-skill <fixture-dir>` against the fixture.** This exercises the full three-tier orchestration end-to-end:
- Scripts execute without shell errors
- Output parses in the expected format
- FAIL findings exclude the file from Tier-2 (no Tier-2 output for malformed files)
- Dimension names used in Tier-2 output match `audit-dimensions.md`
- Tier-3 description-collision detection fires when fixture skills share trigger surface

Fix integration issues.

**Fixture commit is optional.** If the plugin has no existing fixture pattern, keep the fixtures in `/tmp` and document the run in the commit message. If the plugin has a `tests/fixtures/` pattern, add them there. The validation is load-bearing; the committed files aren't.

### Phase 11: PR review

Self-review the entire PR commit-by-commit. Two extra checks before handoff:

- **AGENTS.md / wiki-region check.** Confirm the AGENTS.md auto-region watch-out from Phase 4 actually held — `git diff main -- AGENTS.md` should show only intended changes, no silently-stripped hand-curated content. If `reindex.py` was run more than once across the work, it's the most likely culprit.
- **Pre-existing scripts audit (when adding a routing rule).** If the principles doc or a shared reference introduced a routing rule that affects existing scripts — for example, a "Language Selection" decision that could flip an existing shell script to Python, or a structural convention existing files should now follow — walk those existing files against the new rule. Surface candidates for change in the PR description; do *not* rewrite without explicit user approval. The rule is forward-looking, and pre-emptive churn violates "don't refactor without a reason." Existing scripts port when they need substantive changes anyway.

Then hand off to a human reviewer.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every Core principle meets the inclusion bar: cross-family support (≥2 families per `coverage-llm.md`) AND (Haiku raised it OR the check is mechanically deterministic). Advanced/strong-minority rules are not preserved — they are dropped.
- Every SKILL.md in the pair ends with a `## Handoff` section declaring `Receives:` / `Produces:` / `Chainable to:`. `build-<X>` minimally chains to `check-<X>`; `check-<X>` minimally chains to `build-<X>`. Any additional chain relationships extracted from legacy skills in Phase 1 are preserved unless explicitly deprecated.
- Every principle in the shared doc maps to exactly one audit dimension OR explicit author-time-only.
- Every Tier-2 dimension cites its source principle by name.
- Every Tier-1 script finding (including each subtype a script emits) has a repair-playbook recipe.
- Every script executes cleanly (`./script.sh -h` prints usage; `./script.sh some.md` produces correctly-formatted output).
- The principles doc carries a provenance footnote naming the ensemble run, the panel, and the inclusion bar. Clustering discrepancies between `coverage-llm.md` and `coverage.md` at the Core boundary are documented.
- End-to-end validation on the fixture produces expected output.
- The shared principles doc is 400-800 words, positively framed, no rule-type taxonomy, no "Advanced" section.
- All cross-reference paths resolve (`python3 plugins/wiki/scripts/lint.py` passes).
- Commits are vertical slices; each is reviewable independently; the sequence tells the story.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

1. **Writing principles with negative framing.** Positive from word one; rewriting is expensive.
2. **Preserving legacy principles that the ensemble didn't reaffirm.** Legacy content outside the project-facts extraction is discarded. Do not run a per-opinion keep/loosen/drop walkthrough as a way to smuggle legacy principles past the ensemble inclusion bar.
3. **Preserving rules that failed the inclusion bar in an "Advanced" section.** Dropped means dropped. If a dropped rule is genuinely load-bearing, raise it in conversation so the inclusion bar can be debated — do not smuggle it back in via a side section.
4. **Including a rule-type taxonomy.** Dissolves on contact; don't include.
5. **Using `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in skill-invoked bash.** Documented for hooks only. Use `${SKILL_DIR}` placeholder.
6. **Trigger-gating Tier-2 dimensions.** All dimensions always run; those that don't apply return PASS.
7. **Writing scripts before the breakdown is approved.** The breakdown is the design; scripts are mechanical.
8. **Skipping `/build:build-shell`'s safety check.** It catches real issues in 3+ scripts.
9. **Dimension names drifting across files.** Settle naming in Phase 2; don't renegotiate later.
10. **Scripts that exit 1 on WARN.** Exit 0 on anything short of FAIL.
11. **Skipping end-to-end validation.** First real invocation after merge is the worst place to find integration bugs.
12. **Relying on `coverage.md` alone or `coverage-llm.md` alone.** LLM clustering catches semantic equivalence rapidfuzz misses; rapidfuzz is synthesizer-bias-free. Consume the LLM version as primary but cross-check at borderlines.
13. **Inventing frontmatter fields or section names to fit a mental model of what "feels" right.** The Claude Code skill spec is narrower than common defaults — unknown top-level frontmatter keys are silently ignored by Claude Code and flagged by `check-rule`'s Tier-1. Look up the current spec; cross-check against a peer toolkit skill; ask the user if anything is ambiguous.
14. **Hand-drafting SKILL.md instead of using `/build:build-skill`.** The authoring skill is the canonical path — bypassing it means the skills you produce and the skill that produces them drift apart. If `/build:build-skill` can't produce a passing skill here, fix `/build:build-skill`; don't work around it.
15. **Prescribing a canonical section list in the principles doc that doesn't match the plugin's lived convention.** Required sections become Tier-1 structural checks. Mismatches surface as audit failures on every meta-skill the plugin already ships. Cross-check against peer skills in Phase 0c before locking.
16. **Skipping legacy code-dependency follow-through in Phase 4.** Deleting the legacy SKILL.md's backing Python module without removing its `__init__.py` import, test file, and `pyproject` wiring leaves orphan references that silently break `pip install -e` or hide in import-time side effects. Trace the dependency graph before deleting.

## Estimated effort

- **Greenfield skill pair** (no legacy to displace): ~4 hours of interactive pairing.
- **Rescaffold with code-backed legacy** (existing Python / Node harness to delete or wrap): ~6–8 hours. The extra time goes into the Phase 3 existing-harness decision, the Phase 4 code-dependency cleanup, and the Phase 8 reconciliation between the new principles doc's prescribed shape and the plugin's lived section conventions.
- **Subsequent skill pairs in the same plugin**: ~2–3 hours. Most of the original complexity was in *discovering* the process and the shape the plugin wants; subsequent pairs follow the established skeleton.
