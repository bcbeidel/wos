# Ingest

Update wiki pages from any source: URL, file path, pasted text, or research document.

## Input Handling

Accept the source in any of these forms:

- **URL** — fetch the page content before proceeding
- **File path** — read the file (`.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`, transcript, etc.)
- **Pasted text** — use as-is
- **Research document** (`.research.md`) — read; see [High-Rigor Path](#high-rigor-path) for an opt-in verification step

Resolve the source to readable text before any further steps.

If no source is provided, ask: "What source should I ingest? (URL, file path, or paste content directly)"

## Pre-Ingest

Before editing any files, read the project's wiki context:

1. **Read `wiki/_index.md`** — understand the existing page inventory (titles, descriptions, file paths)
2. **List the `wiki/` directory tree** — run `ls -R wiki/` or equivalent to see existing subdirectories and their contents. This informs where new pages should be placed to fit contextually alongside related existing content.
3. **Read `wiki/SCHEMA.md`** — learn the valid `type` values, `confidence` tiers, and relationship types for this project

If `wiki/_index.md` or `wiki/SCHEMA.md` is missing, stop and report the missing file. Suggest running `/wiki:setup` to initialize wiki infrastructure.

## Ingest Protocol

With the source content and wiki context in hand:

### Step 0: Discuss Key Takeaways

Before proposing the page list, present your reading of the source to the user
and invite correction. This is the default behaviour — skip only when
`--no-discuss` is passed.

**Single source:**

```
Here are the key takeaways from [Source Title]:
- ...
- ...

Does this capture the important ideas? Anything missing or worth
emphasizing differently before I propose the page list?
```

**Multiple sources (bulk mode):** Present takeaways for all sources in a single
consolidated discussion — one list per source, one round of feedback for all.
Do not run a separate round-trip per source.

**Opt-out:** If the user passes `--no-discuss`, skip this step entirely and
proceed directly to Step 1.

### Step 1: Identify Affected Pages

Identify **5–15 wiki pages** that this source meaningfully informs — both:
- **Existing pages** that should be updated with new information or connections
- **New pages** to create for topics the source covers that have no existing page

If the source is narrow and fewer than 5 pages genuinely apply, proceed with what applies. Do not pad.

**Emergent path selection for new pages:** Based on the existing `wiki/` directory structure read in Pre-Ingest, propose a subdirectory path that fits contextually — place the new page alongside existing pages on related topics. Example: if `wiki/llm-patterns/` already exists with caching pages, a new page on cache invalidation belongs at `wiki/llm-patterns/cache-invalidation.md`, not `wiki/cache-invalidation.md`. If no relevant subdirectory exists, propose a new one whose name reflects the topic cluster. The user can override any proposed path at Step 1b.

**Source summary page:** Always include one source summary page for the ingested source (see [Step 3a](#step-3a-create-source-summary-page)). Place it in a subdirectory that fits contextually alongside related pages — the same emergent path logic applies. Idempotency: if a source summary page already exists for this URL (matched by URL in the `sources:` frontmatter field), update it rather than creating a duplicate — append new claims, never remove existing ones.

### Step 1b: Confirm Before Writing

Present the proposed changes to the user before modifying any file:

```
Ready to ingest into N pages:
- UPDATE wiki/existing-page.md — adding [summary of additions]
- CREATE wiki/llm-patterns/new-topic.md — [description of new page]
...

Proceed? (yes / edit list / cancel)
```

Paths for new pages include the proposed subdirectory. The user can edit any path before confirming.

Wait for explicit confirmation. If the user edits the list, revise accordingly. Do not modify any wiki files until confirmed.

### Step 2: Update Each Page

For each affected page, apply all changes that are warranted:

**Content (append-only):** Add new information, examples, or elaboration at the appropriate location in the page. Never remove or rewrite existing prose — only add. If existing content conflicts with the source, flag it (see Contradiction Handling below) rather than overwriting it.

**Frontmatter updates:**
- `sources:` — append the source URL or file path (deduplicate if already present)
- `updated:` — set to today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `type:` — assign or confirm the page type per `wiki/SCHEMA.md`
- `confidence:` — assign or update the confidence tier per `wiki/SCHEMA.md`, reflecting the source's authority and corroboration with existing pages
- `related:` — add cross-references to other wiki pages that this source connects

### Step 3: Create New Pages

For topics the source covers with no existing wiki page, create a new page:

- Path: `wiki/<slug>.md` (derive slug from topic name)
- Include full frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `type`, `confidence`, `sources`, `created`, `updated`
- Write an initial page body from the source content — follow the structure of existing wiki pages
- Add `related:` links to existing pages that connect

### Step 3a: Create Source Summary Page

For every ingest, create (or update) a source summary page in addition to the
concept and entity pages.

**Structure:**

```markdown
---
name: <Source Title>
description: One-sentence summary of the source
type: source-summary
sources: [<URL or file path>]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# <Source Title>

**Author:** ...  **Date:** ...  **URL:** ...

## Key Claims

- Claim 1
- Claim 2

## Summary

[Structured summary of what the source says]
```

**Factual-only constraint:** Source summary pages record what the source says.
No interpretation, synthesis, or evaluation. Those belong in concept and
synthesis pages.

**Idempotency:** Match an existing source summary page by URL in its `sources:`
frontmatter. If found, append new claims — do not create a duplicate, do not
remove existing claims.

### Step 4: Contradiction Handling

If source content contradicts information in an existing page, do **not** overwrite the existing claim. Instead, append a contradiction marker immediately after the conflicting passage:

```
<!-- CONTRADICTION: [source] states "[new claim]". Existing content says "[current claim]". Verify which is correct. -->
```

Report all contradiction markers to the user at the end of ingest.

## Append-Only Constraint

Existing prose in wiki pages is never removed or overwritten. Every `git diff` after an ingest should show only additions (new lines, frontmatter field updates, appended content). If you find yourself deleting or rewriting existing text, stop — append instead or flag a contradiction.

## Post-Ingest

After all page updates and creations, run lint:

```bash
python3 <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py --root <project-root> --no-urls
```

Report results to the user:
- If lint produces new issues, list them with severity

Do not block on lint issues — report and continue.

**Operation log:** Append an entry to `wiki/log.md` (create the file if it does
not exist). Append-only — never modify existing entries.

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <Source Title>
<N> pages updated, <M> created. Pages: wiki/path/a.md, wiki/path/b.md.
```

## High-Rigor Path

When the source is a research document (`.research.md` file), offer the user an opt-in SIFT verification step before ingest:

> "This source is a research document. Would you like to run SIFT verification before ingesting? (default: skip)"

- **Skip (default):** Proceed directly to the Ingest Protocol
- **Verify:** Invoke `/wiki:research` with the document to validate sources, then ingest the verified findings

The high-rigor path is never required. It is appropriate when the user wants to confirm source credibility before committing findings to the wiki.

## Examples

**URL ingest:**
> "Ingest this article: https://example.com/llm-caching"
→ Fetch content → read wiki context → identify 5–15 pages → update/create pages → lint

**File ingest:**
> "Add to wiki: docs/research/2026-04-10-caching-patterns.research.md"
→ Read file → offer SIFT opt-in → read wiki context → identify pages → update/create → lint

**Pasted text:**
> "Ingest this: [user pastes a block of notes]"
→ Use pasted text as source → read wiki context → proceed

## Key Instructions

- **Won't overwrite existing prose** — ingest is append-only; every `git diff` should show only additions
- **Won't write until confirmed** — Step 1b gate is non-negotiable; present the full list and wait for approval
- **Won't ingest without reading wiki context first** — `wiki/_index.md` and `wiki/SCHEMA.md` must be read before any changes
- **Recovery:** if an ingest produces unwanted changes, use `git diff` to review and `git checkout -- wiki/` to revert; all writes are isolated to the `wiki/` directory

## Anti-Pattern Guards

1. **Separate discussion round per source in bulk mode** — when ingesting multiple sources, running one discussion round per source creates unnecessary back-and-forth. Consolidate all sources into a single takeaways discussion before moving to the page list.
2. **Overwriting existing prose** — every `git diff` after ingest should show only additions. Rewriting existing content destroys the provenance trail and may silently lose validated information. If existing content is wrong, flag a contradiction marker instead.
3. **Writing interpretation into source summary pages** — source summary pages record what the source says, not what you conclude from it. Synthesis and evaluation belong in concept or synthesis pages, not in `type: source-summary` pages.
2. **Skipping Pre-Ingest reads** — proceeding without reading `wiki/_index.md` and `wiki/SCHEMA.md` causes type/confidence misassignment and duplicate page creation. These are required reads, not optional context.
3. **Silent contradiction** — when source content conflicts with an existing page, the anti-pattern is choosing one version silently. The correct action is the contradiction marker. Unresolved conflicts belong to the user, not the ingest operation.
4. **Padding to hit the 5-page minimum** — if a narrow source genuinely affects fewer than 5 pages, proceed with what applies. Forcing connections to reach a target count produces low-quality updates that degrade the wiki.
5. **Assigning confidence without cross-referencing** — confidence tier should reflect corroboration across pages, not just the source's claimed authority. A single primary source warrants `medium` at best until cross-referenced with existing wiki content.

## Handoff
