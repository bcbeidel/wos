# Audit Skill

Observe and report on project content quality. Read-only -- reports but
does not modify any files.

## Workflow

1. **Run** `lint.py` against the project root (see [How to Run](#how-to-run))
2. **Checks** — the script applies four check categories; results are collected (see [The Checks](#the-checks))
3. **Interpret** — present the findings table to the user (see [Interpreting Results](#interpreting-results))
4. **Cleanup** — for actionable findings (missing setup, blocked URLs), offer guided resolution (see [Cleanup Actions](#cleanup-actions))

Each phase depends on the previous. Do not offer cleanup actions before presenting results.

## How to Run

```bash
# Default: fast, offline checks only
python <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py --root .

# Include URL reachability (network-dependent, off by default)
python <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py --root . --urls

# Validate a single file
python <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py path/to/file.md --root .

# JSON output for programmatic use
python <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py --root . --json

# Exit 1 on any issue (including warnings)
python <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py --root . --strict

# Override the resolver-recommendation threshold (default: 3)
python <plugin-scripts-dir>/lint.py --root . --resolver-threshold 5
```

Exit code: 1 if any `fail`, 0 if only `warn`. Use `--strict` to exit 1 on any issue.

## The Checks

### 1. Frontmatter Validation (fail)

Verifies:
- **fail:** `name` and `description` are non-empty

Other frontmatter fields (`type`, `sources`, `confidence`, schema-defined
values, etc.) are not enforced here. Project-specific schema validation
belongs in the project's own conventions — `wiki/SCHEMA.md` lint hooks
in when present.

### 2. Source URL Reachability (fail + warn) — opt-in

Checks that every URL in `sources` is reachable via HTTP. **Off by
default** (network-dependent, slow). Enable with `--urls`. URLs
returning 403/429 are downgraded to `warn` — these sites likely block
automated checks, not dead links.

### 3. Related Path Validation (fail)

Checks that local file paths in `related` exist on disk.

### 4. Resolver Threshold (warn)

Warns when no `RESOLVER.md` exists at the project root but enough
top-level directories contain ≥2 markdown files with valid YAML
frontmatter (ambient dirs like `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`
excluded). The recommendation is to run `/build:build-resolver`.

The default threshold is 3 conventionful directories — override with
`--resolver-threshold N`. Routing-artifact quality (when a resolver
*does* exist) is not checked here — see
[Resolver Evaluation](#resolver-evaluation).

## Interpreting Results

Summary line first, then table:

```
2 fail across 15 files

file                              | sev  | issue
docs/context/api/auth.md           | fail | Frontmatter 'name' is empty
docs/context/api/another.md        | fail | Source URL unreachable
```

With `--json`, output is a JSON array of objects:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "docs/context/area/topic.md",
    "issue": "Frontmatter 'name' is empty",
    "severity": "fail"
  }
]
```

A clean project produces:

```
All checks passed.
```

## Cleanup Actions

After presenting audit results, offer to help resolve actionable warnings:

- **Missing AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md:** Offer to run `/wiki:setup` to
  initialize. Confirm with the user before writing any files.
- **AGENTS.md missing managed-section markers:** Offer to run `/wiki:setup`
  to add the managed section. Confirm before modifying existing content.
- **CLAUDE.md missing @AGENTS.md reference:** Offer to add the reference.
  Do not rewrite CLAUDE.md contents — only add the `@AGENTS.md` line.
- **Missing RESOLVER.md (threshold crossed):** Offer to run
  `/build:build-resolver` to scaffold a routing table. Show the
  conventionful directories the lint check detected so the user can
  judge whether the recommendation fits.
- **403/429 URL warnings:** List the blocked URLs and the files they
  appear in. Ask the user to verify them manually — these sites likely
  block automated checks rather than indicate dead links. The user
  decides whether each URL is still valid; lint does not prescribe a
  verification protocol.

## Key Instructions

- Audit is strictly read-only — no log files, no side effects
- Use `/wiki:setup` to initialize missing project structure
- Empty project (no convention-following directories) exits 0 with no issues

## Skill Evaluation

Skill quality evaluation is handled entirely by `/build:check-skill` — lint does
not run automated Python-level skill checks. Invoke `/build:check-skill` on each
skill directory found and incorporate its findings into the report. Do not perform
independent skill quality judgment here — `check-skill` is the single source of
truth for what good looks like. Delegating keeps criteria consistent and prevents
drift between the two skills.

If the user ran lint on a specific skill path, pass that path to `check-skill`.
If lint ran across the full project, offer: "Found N skill(s) — run
`/build:check-skill` to evaluate quality?"

## Resolver Evaluation

Routing-artifact evaluation is handled entirely by `/build:check-resolver` —
lint does not audit `RESOLVER.md`, the AGENTS.md pointer, or
`.resolver/evals.yml`. When `RESOLVER.md` exists at the project root, offer:
"Found a resolver — run `/build:check-resolver` to audit filing coverage,
context actionability, and eval pass rate?"

Do not duplicate the resolver audit dimensions here — `check-resolver` is the
single source of truth for routing quality, the same way `check-skill` is for
skills. The lint script's own resolver check is intentionally narrow: it only
warns when no `RESOLVER.md` exists but the repo crosses the threshold.

## Anti-Pattern Guards

1. **Attributing pre-existing issues to recent changes** — a project may have accumulated failures before your work began. Establish a baseline before blaming new issues on recent changes. Run lint on the main branch first, then compare.
2. **Dismissing warn-tier findings** — warns that are never enforced become noise that teams learn to ignore. Each warn represents degradation; a project with 50 active warns is not "clean." Address warns or explicitly accept them with a rationale.
3. **Using --strict as a substitute for fixing root causes** — `--strict` promotes all warnings to failures, which is appropriate for CI gating. Using it to artificially block progress without fixing the underlying issues is not.
4. **Skipping individual error messages** — lint output is not a pass/fail score; it is a diagnostic. Every issue entry specifies a file, line, and reason. Reading the summary number without reading the individual issues skips the diagnostic value entirely.

## Handoff

**Receives:** Project root path (defaults to CWD); optional flags (--urls, --strict)
**Produces:** Validation report listing warnings and failures by file; read-only — no modifications made
**Chainable to:** `/build:check-skill` (per-skill quality); `/build:check-resolver` (routing-artifact audit when RESOLVER.md exists); `/build:build-resolver` (when threshold is crossed without one)
