# Build Hook

Scaffold a Claude Code hook — an event-driven handler that enforces a quality
gate deterministically, bypassing LLM judgment. See
[hook-best-practices.md](../../_shared/references/hook-best-practices.md) for the
rubric both halves of the pair share.

**Workflow sequence:** 0. Brief → 1. Route → 2. Scope Gate → 3. Elicit →
4. Draft → 5. Safety Check → 6. Stop Hook Guard (conditional) →
7. Rule Overlap → 8. Review Gate → 9. Save → 10. Test

## 0. Brief

Capture intent before any other action. Write
`.briefs/<hook-name>.brief.md` from the user's intake. The slug is
the hook name derived from the enforcement goal (e.g.,
`block-main-push`, `redact-secrets-on-save`); pre-fill from
`$ARGUMENTS` `[hook event] [enforcement goal]` if present, otherwise
ask now. Format follows
[brief-best-practices.md](../../_shared/references/brief-best-practices.md):
five required H2 sections (*User ask*, *So-what*, *Scope boundaries*,
*Planned artifacts*, *Planned handoffs*) plus an empty *Decisions log*.

Pre-populate the two checklists from the planned workflow:

- **Planned artifacts** — the two files produced by Step 9 Save:
  hook script under `.claude/hooks/<name>.sh` and the `settings.json`
  entry snippet (shown for manual application, not auto-patched).
- **Planned handoffs** — `/build:check-hook` (audit). If a structured
  payload requires non-trivial parsing past the trivial-glue
  threshold, also `/build:check-bash-script` or
  `/build:check-python-script` once the script is written.

If `.briefs/<hook-name>.brief.md` already exists, read it and ask
whether to update (default yes) or abandon and recreate (default no).
Do not overwrite the brief silently.

## 1. Route

Confirm a hook is the right primitive. Full framework:
[primitive-routing.md](../../_shared/references/primitive-routing.md).

- **Unconditional permanent block** (never allow tool X, no exceptions ever) →
  route to `settings.json` `permissions.deny`.
- **Advisory guidance or preference** (prefer X, follow this convention) →
  route to CLAUDE.md or `/build:build-skill`.
- **Semantic judgment on file content** (convention too nuanced for grep) →
  route to `/build:build-rule`.
- **Specific lifecycle trigger + must fire regardless of LLM judgment** →
  proceed.

## 2. Scope Gate

Refuse — and recommend an alternative — when any of these signal:

1. **The goal is a preference, not an invariant.** Hooks spend their authority
   on false positives. If the user is unsure whether they'd want a bypass path,
   the goal is advisory — route to CLAUDE.md or a skill.
2. **The check needs semantic judgment.** If the criterion cannot be expressed
   as a shell one-liner or a lean script (format, naming pattern, file
   existence, command shape), route to `/build:build-rule`.
3. **No lifecycle event maps to the goal.** If the trigger is "after the user
   thinks about X," there is no hook to write.

## 3. Elicit

If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, parse as `[hook-event] [enforcement-goal]` —
pre-fill the first two fields, confirm with the user, then ask only the
handler-type question. Otherwise ask one at a time:

1. **Hook event** — which lifecycle moment? See the event table in
   [hook-best-practices.md §Anatomy §Event selection](../../_shared/references/hook-best-practices.md).
   If the goal is to block, the event must be PreToolUse or another blockable event.
2. **Handler type** — `command` (default), `http`, `prompt`, or `agent`. Default
   to `command` unless the enforcement genuinely needs an LLM.
3. **Enforcement goal** — one sentence. Confirm before drafting.

## 4. Draft

Re-read the brief's *So-what* and *Scope boundaries* before drafting.
Drift toward generic "block X / enforce Y" framing in the script
header or the settings entry comment is the lossy-compression
failure mode the brief exists to counter.

Produce two artifacts, referencing the Anatomy section of the principles
doc for every shape decision (skeleton, matcher syntax, JSON output contract,
settings.json entry, path-expansion variables). Tick each item in
*Planned artifacts* off in `.briefs/<hook-name>.brief.md` as it is
drafted.

**Artifact 1 — Hook script.** Start from the skeleton in
[hook-best-practices.md §Anatomy §Script skeleton](../../_shared/references/hook-best-practices.md).
Fill in the enforcement logic.

**Artifact 2 — settings.json entry.** Start from the entry shape in
[hook-best-practices.md §Anatomy §Settings.json entry shape](../../_shared/references/hook-best-practices.md).
Pick a `timeout` appropriate for the gate (10–60 s typical).

Present both artifacts to the user before the Safety Check.

## 5. Safety Check

Review the draft against the audit rubric in
[audit-dimensions.md](../check-hook/references/audit-dimensions.md) —
the same dimensions `/build:check-hook` uses. Revise until each applicable
dimension passes. High-leverage checks for a fresh scaffold:

- `exit-code-contract` — blocking intent uses `exit 2`, not `exit 1` or an unthrown exception.
- `async-blocking-coherence` — `async: true` and `exit 2` are mutually exclusive.
- `stdin-consumption` — `INPUT=$(cat)` is present; the script is executable.
- `command-path-expansion` — `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` or absolute path; never `$HOME` / `~`.
- `injection-safety` — no `eval` on payload values; all expansions quoted; `jq --arg` for variable injection.
- `jq-handling` — availability check present; field paths match the matcher's tool.
- `shell-hygiene` — `set -Eeuo pipefail`; errors to stderr; `[[` over `[`; `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- `destructive-operations` — no `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git checkout .`.

## 6. Stop Hook Guard

**Only for `Stop` and `SubagentStop` events.** Skip otherwise.

A Stop hook that exits 2 without a re-entry guard creates an infinite loop.
Apply the belt-and-suspenders pattern from
[hook-best-practices.md §Patterns That Work](../../_shared/references/hook-best-practices.md):

- **SubagentStop:** inspect `stop_hook_active` and `last_assistant_message`.
- **Stop:** use a session-scoped guard file keyed to `session_id` (the `Stop` payload lacks `stop_hook_active`).

## 7. Rule Overlap

Scan `CLAUDE.md` for instructions that express the same enforcement goal.
If found, note the overlap and ask:

> "CLAUDE.md already says [X]. A hook enforces this deterministically
> (CLAUDE.md is advisory). Do you want both (belt-and-suspenders), only
> the hook (deterministic), or is CLAUDE.md sufficient?"

The user decides — overlap is often intentional.

## 8. Review Gate

Present both artifacts — script and settings.json entry — and wait for
explicit user approval before writing. If the user requests changes, revise
and re-present. Proceed only on explicit approval.

**Checklist verification.** Before accepting the build, read
`.briefs/<hook-name>.brief.md` and confirm every item in *Planned
artifacts* is checked off. Unchecked items are a Review-Gate fail —
either the artifact was forgotten, or scope changed and the brief
needs updating with a *Decisions log* entry justifying the drop.
*Planned handoffs* may remain unchecked here; those land in Step 10.

## 9. Save

Write the approved script to `.claude/hooks/<name>.sh` (or a path the user
specifies). Make it executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/<name>.sh`.

Show the settings.json patch for the user to apply manually. Do not
auto-patch `settings.json` — it may contain permission entries and other
hook arrays that should not be overwritten.

## 10. Test

Follow the three-layer verification in
[hook-testing.md](references/hook-testing.md) — configuration, logic
isolation, execution trace — before activating the hook.

Then offer:

> "Run `/build:check-hook` to audit the configuration for coverage gaps,
> misconfigurations, and safety issues?"

## Example

Invocation: `/build:build-hook PreToolUse "block direct pushes to main"`

Route confirms the goal is an invariant (not advisory) and maps to a
blockable event — PreToolUse on Bash can refuse a `git push` to `main`.
Proceeds to Elicit.

Elicit pre-fills event = `PreToolUse`, enforcement goal = "block direct
pushes to main". Asks only handler type; user confirms `command`.

Draft produces two artifacts from the principles-doc skeleton:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -Eeuo pipefail
INPUT=$(cat)
command -v jq &>/dev/null || { echo "jq required" >&2; exit 2; }

CMD=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')
if [[ "$CMD" =~ git[[:space:]]+push[[:space:]]+.*\bmain\b ]]; then
  echo "blocked: direct pushes to main are gated; push to a feature branch" >&2
  exit 2
fi
exit 0
```

```json
{"hooks":{"PreToolUse":[{"matcher":"Bash","hooks":[{"type":"command",
 "command":"\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/block-main-push.sh",
 "timeout":10}]}]}}
```

Safety Check confirms: `exit-code-contract` (`exit 2` on block),
`stdin-consumption` (`INPUT=$(cat)`), `command-path-expansion`
(`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`), `injection-safety` (quoted expansion, no `eval`),
`jq-handling` (availability check present, Bash field path correct),
`shell-hygiene` (preamble, stderr). Not a Stop event — skip §6. Rule
Overlap scan: no matching CLAUDE.md instruction. Review Gate: user
approves.

Save writes `.claude/hooks/block-main-push.sh`, runs `chmod +x`, shows
the settings.json snippet for manual merge.

Test runs the three-layer verification from `hook-testing.md`, then
offers `/build:check-hook` to audit the configuration.

## Anti-Pattern Guards

1. **Skipping Route/Scope Gate.** A goal that fits `permissions.deny` or CLAUDE.md should never reach the Draft step.
2. **Blocking via PostToolUse.** PostToolUse cannot prevent execution;
   presenting a PostToolUse draft for a blocking goal is a misconfiguration
   that silently fails to enforce.
3. **`async: true` with `exit 2`.** Async hooks run after execution regardless of exit code.
4. **Writing files before the Review Gate.** Skipping the gate bypasses the only safety checkpoint.
5. **Auto-patching `settings.json`.** Always show the snippet; let the user apply.
6. **Inlining a chained skill instead of invoking it.** When a hook's
   script grows past trivial glue and warrants `/build:check-bash-script`
   or `/build:check-python-script`, MUST invoke the chained skill
   via the Skill tool (paste the brief's *So-what* + the relevant
   audit dimension into the prompt). MUST NOT read its SKILL.md and
   inline a partial implementation. The shortcut bypasses the chained
   skill's rubric and leaves no audit trail that the proper skill
   was used.

## Key Instructions

- Do not write any file to disk before the Review Gate passes.
- Do not auto-patch `settings.json`; always show the snippet for manual application.
- Won't build a hook when `permissions.deny` covers the goal — unconditional blocks need no script.
- Won't build a hook for advisory guidance — suggest CLAUDE.md or a skill instead.
- Won't skip the Safety Check against `audit-dimensions.md`.
- Recovery if a hook is written in error: `chmod -x .claude/hooks/<name>.sh`
  (disables without deleting) or remove the file and its `settings.json`
  entry. A configured hook whose script is missing or non-executable silently
  fails and leaves normal tool flow intact.

## Handoff

**Receives:** Hook event, handler type, enforcement goal.
**Produces:** Hook script at `.claude/hooks/<name>.sh` + settings.json entry snippet.
**Chainable to:** `/build:check-hook` (audit the hook against `audit-dimensions.md`).
