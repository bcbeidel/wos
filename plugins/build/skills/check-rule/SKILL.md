# /build:check-rule

Evaluate the quality of an existing Claude Code rule library. Three tiers,
in order: deterministic format checks (no LLM), per-rule semantic checks
(eight always-on dimensions in a single locked-rubric call), then
cross-rule conflict detection.

This skill evaluates the rules themselves — not files against rules.

The audit rubric mirrors the authoring principles in
[rule-best-practices.md](../../_shared/references/rule-best-practices.md).
Each Tier-2 dimension cites its source principle. When the principles doc
changes, the dimensions should follow.

## Workflow

### 1. Discover Rules

Rule files live under `.claude/rules/**/*.md` (recursive). When `$ARGUMENTS`
resolves to a path, scope discovery to that file or directory. When
`$ARGUMENTS` is empty, scan `.claude/rules/` and (if the user maintains
personal rules) `~/.claude/rules/`.

Report: "Found N rules. Auditing..."

### 2. Tier 1 — Deterministic Format Checks

Tier 1 is implemented as six scripts under `scripts/` — four Python 3
scripts for structural and pattern work, plus two bash scripts for
pure text glue. Each is deterministic and emits findings in the
standard `FAIL|WARN|INFO|HINT  <path> — <check>: <detail>` format.
See [audit-dimensions.md](references/audit-dimensions.md) for the full
rubric behind each check.

Invoke all six scripts against the discovered rule set. The scripts
live in `scripts/` relative to this SKILL.md — Claude resolves the
absolute path from the skill's base directory at invocation time
(`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is documented for hook scripts, not skill-invoked
scripts; don't rely on it here):

```bash
# SKILL_DIR = absolute path to this SKILL.md's directory (Claude fills in)
SCRIPTS="${SKILL_DIR}/scripts"
TARGETS="$ARGUMENTS"  # path(s) from user; default .claude/rules/

python3 "$SCRIPTS/scan_secrets.py"     $TARGETS   # FAIL on any committed-secret pattern
python3 "$SCRIPTS/check_structure.py"  $TARGETS   # FAIL location/extension; INFO unknown keys
python3 "$SCRIPTS/check_paths_glob.py" $TARGETS   # FAIL unbalanced braces/brackets, empty, cntrl
bash    "$SCRIPTS/check_size.sh"       $TARGETS   # WARN >200 lines, FAIL >500 lines
python3 "$SCRIPTS/check_prose.py"      $TARGETS   # WARN hedges/prohibitions/synthetic placeholders
bash    "$SCRIPTS/emit_shape_hints.sh" $TARGETS   # HINT lines for Tier-2 prompt context
```

**Script-to-check map:**

| Script | Checks | Severity levels |
|---|---|---|
| `scan_secrets.py` | AWS / GitHub / OpenAI / Anthropic / Stripe key patterns + credential-shaped variable assignments | FAIL |
| `check_structure.py` | Location (under `.claude/rules/`), Extension (`.md`, no double-extension), Frontmatter shape (only `paths:` documented) | FAIL / FAIL / INFO |
| `check_paths_glob.py` | Balanced `{…}` and `[…]`, non-empty, no control chars | FAIL |
| `check_size.sh` | Non-blank-line count against 200/500 thresholds | WARN / FAIL |
| `check_prose.py` | Prose pre-check: hedges (Specificity), prohibition-only openers (Framing), synthetic placeholders in code blocks (Example Realism) | WARN |
| `emit_shape_hints.sh` | Keyword signals (`compliant`, `non-compliant`, `violation`, `exception`, `failure`, code blocks) | HINT (informational) |

**Orchestration rules:**

- Emit all Tier-1 output immediately, before any LLM work.
- Rules with a FAIL finding from `scan_secrets.py`, `check_structure.py` (location/extension), or `check_paths_glob.py` are **excluded from Tier 2** — malformed rules don't reach the LLM step.
- `check_size.sh` FAIL (>500 lines) also excludes from Tier 2.
- `check_size.sh` WARN, `check_structure.py` INFO, and `check_prose.py` WARN findings do **not** exclude — they accompany Tier-2 output (and `check_prose.py` WARNs specifically feed Tier-2 dimensions as pre-filter signals for Specificity / Framing / Example Realism).
- `emit_shape_hints.sh` HINT lines are not findings; collect them per file and include in the Tier-2 prompt as context so the evaluator weighs Why Adequacy and Example Realism appropriately.
- Exit code of each script is 0 on clean / WARN-only / HINT-only, 1 on FAIL. The orchestrator treats exit 1 as the "exclude from Tier 2" signal.

### 3. Tier 2 — Per-Rule Semantic Checks (One LLM Call per Rule)

For each structurally valid rule, one locked-rubric LLM call assesses
the eight always-on dimensions in
[audit-dimensions.md](references/audit-dimensions.md):

1. **Framing** — positive statement of what to do; no hedged phrasing
2. **Specificity** — directive is concrete and falsifiable
3. **Single Concern** — body covers one topic
4. **Why Adequacy** — reasoning present; judgment-based rules name failure cost + legitimate exception
5. **Scope Tightness** — `paths:` matches the rule's actual reach; unscoped rules that name a specific directory get flagged
6. **Staleness** — globs resolve to real paths; examples look current
7. **Judgment-Not-Linter** — rule doesn't restate what a formatter or type-checker already catches
8. **Example Realism** — if examples present, they use domain-specific identifiers from the codebase, not synthetic `foo`/`bar`

Include the full rule file verbatim — never summarize. Present all
eight dimensions in one call (per-dimension calls degrade agreement
by ~11.5 points per RULERS, Hong et al. 2026). Dimensions that don't
apply to the specific rule return PASS silently — e.g., Example Realism
PASSes on a rule with no examples.

Output format per dimension: `evidence (quoted from rule) → reasoning →
verdict (WARN or PASS) → recommendation`. Default-closed: borderline
evidence surfaces as WARN, not PASS — this is evaluator policy; rules
themselves don't declare it.

### 4. Tier 3 — Cross-Rule Conflict Detection

After per-rule evaluation, compare rule pairs that could fire on the
same file. Two rules can conflict when:
- Both are always-on (no `paths:`), OR
- Their `paths:` globs overlap

For each candidate pair:
1. Present both rule files verbatim
2. Ask: "If a developer follows Rule A's guidance exactly, does Rule B
   contradict?"
3. Ask the reverse
4. If either answer is yes → FAIL finding citing both rule names and the
   specific contradiction

Anthropic's warning is the basis: *"if two rules contradict each other,
Claude may pick one arbitrarily."*

### 5. Report Findings

Output all findings in `scripts/lint.py` format (file, issue, severity).
Sort within each severity tier: Tier-1 deterministic first, then Tier-2
in dimension order (Framing → Specificity → Single Concern → Why
Adequacy → Scope Tightness → Staleness → Judgment-Not-Linter → Example
Realism), then Tier-3 conflicts; ties break alphabetically by file path.
FAIL precedes WARN overall.

Each FAIL or WARN finding must include a `Recommendation:` line with a
specific, actionable repair drawn from
[repair-playbook.md](references/repair-playbook.md). Generic suggestions
("fix this") are not acceptable — name the exact change.

```
FAIL  .claude/rules/api-handlers.md — Malformed paths glob: "src/api/**/*.{ts" — unclosed brace
  Recommendation: Close the brace: `"src/api/**/*.{ts,tsx}"`
WARN  .claude/rules/code-style.md — Specificity: "format code properly" is anchor-free
  Recommendation: Replace with a verifiable directive (e.g., "Use 2-space indentation; run prettier --check")
WARN  .claude/rules/testing.md — File length 287 lines exceeds 200-line guidance
  Recommendation: Split into topic files (e.g., testing-unit.md + testing-integration.md)
WARN  .claude/rules/api-errors.md — Framing: rule states only what to avoid, no positive action named
  Recommendation: Restate as a positive directive (e.g., "Return structured error responses via `ApiError`") instead of "Don't throw raw errors"
```

Close with a summary line:
- Findings present: `N rules audited, M findings (X fail, Y warn)`
- No findings: `N rules audited — no findings`

### 6. Opt-In Repair Loop

After presenting findings, ask:

> "Apply fixes? Enter y (all), n (skip), or comma-separated numbers."

For each selected finding, draw the canonical repair from
[repair-playbook.md](references/repair-playbook.md). Then:

1. Read the relevant section of the rule file
2. Apply the canonical repair (if no playbook entry exists, skip and
   flag for manual review — do not improvise)
3. Show the diff
4. Write the change only on user confirmation
5. Re-run Tier-1 deterministic checks after each applied fix

Per-change confirmation is required — bulk application removes the
user's ability to review individual repairs.

## Key Instructions

- Run Tier-1 deterministic checks first; gate LLM evaluation on structural validity so malformed rules surface as findings, not as expensive LLM calls
- Include the Tier-1 shape-hints keyword sniff as context in the Tier-2 prompt — it informs the evaluator, not the dimension set (all eight dimensions always run)
- Present all eight Tier-2 dimensions as a single locked-rubric call per rule — per-dimension calls degrade agreement by ~11.5 points (RULERS, Hong et al. 2026)
- Include the full rule file verbatim in every LLM evaluation so the evaluator sees the same anchors a human reviewer would
- Limit conflict comparison to rule pairs that could co-fire (both always-on, or overlapping `paths:` globs) — non-overlapping scoped rules cannot contradict and the comparison is wasted budget
- Surface borderline evidence as WARN (default-closed) so ambiguous cases enter the report rather than silently passing — this is evaluator policy, not a per-rule requirement

## Anti-Pattern Guards

1. **Per-dimension LLM call** — collapse into one locked-rubric call per rule (per-dimension splits degrade agreement by 11.5 points, RULERS)
2. **LLM-evaluating format compliance** — handle frontmatter / glob syntax with deterministic parse (Tier 1); send only structurally valid rules to the LLM
3. **Ambiguous compliance reported as PASS** — surface as WARN (default-closed) so the user sees the borderline case
4. **Vague finding text** — cite the specific rule file and the exact phrasing or field that triggered the finding
5. **Conflict-comparing non-overlapping rules** — gate Tier 3 on co-fire potential (always-on pair, or overlapping `paths:`)
6. **Generic repair text** ("fix this", "improve specificity") — every Recommendation names the specific change, drawn from `repair-playbook.md`
7. **Trigger-gating Tier-2 dimensions** — don't skip dimensions based on whether the rule "opts into" a shape; run all eight always. Dimensions that don't apply return PASS silently

## Example

<example>
User: `/build:check-rule .claude/rules/`

Step 1 — Discovers 3 rules: code-style.md, api-design.md, testing.md

Step 2 — Tier 1 deterministic check:
- code-style.md: 47 lines, no frontmatter (always-on) — passes to Tier 2
- api-design.md: `paths: "src/api/**/*.{ts"` — unclosed brace → FAIL (excluded from Tier 2)
- testing.md: 287 lines → WARN (proceeds to Tier 2 anyway; below 500-line FAIL threshold)

Step 3 — Tier 2 semantic on 2 rules:
- code-style.md: contains "format code properly" → WARN (Specificity). Rule is entirely positive → PASS (Framing). Covers only code style → PASS (Single Concern). No examples → PASS (Example Realism, N/A).
- testing.md: covers unit, integration, AND e2e → WARN (Single Concern). Has compliant/non-compliant examples using `foo`/`bar` → WARN (Example Realism). Rule phrased as "Don't write flaky tests" with no positive counterpart → WARN (Framing).

Step 4 — Tier 3 conflict detection: code-style.md (always-on) and
testing.md (always-on) both fire on every session. No directive
contradiction found.

Output:
```
FAIL  .claude/rules/api-design.md — Malformed paths glob: unclosed brace
  Recommendation: Close the brace: `"src/api/**/*.{ts,tsx}"`
WARN  .claude/rules/code-style.md — Specificity: "format code properly" is anchor-free
  Recommendation: Replace with a verifiable directive (e.g., "Use 2-space indentation; run prettier --check")
WARN  .claude/rules/testing.md — File length 287 lines exceeds 200-line guidance
  Recommendation: Split into testing-unit.md + testing-integration.md + testing-e2e.md
WARN  .claude/rules/testing.md — Single Concern: covers three distinct topics (unit, integration, e2e)
  Recommendation: Same split as above resolves both findings
WARN  .claude/rules/testing.md — Framing: "Don't write flaky tests" states only what to avoid
  Recommendation: Restate positively (e.g., "Write tests that produce the same result given the same inputs")
WARN  .claude/rules/testing.md — Example Realism: examples use `foo`/`bar` placeholders
  Recommendation: Replace with real code from the codebase

3 rules audited, 6 findings (1 fail, 5 warn)
```
