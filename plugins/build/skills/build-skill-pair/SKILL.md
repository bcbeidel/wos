# Build Skill Pair

Create a primitive-pair: two skills that share a single distilled
rubric. `build-<primitive>` scaffolds; `check-<primitive>` audits; both
point at the same principles doc so creation and review never drift.
The distillation step — reconciling multiple inputs into one
internally-consistent rubric — is where this skill earns its keep.

**Workflow sequence:** 0. Brief → 1. Route → 2. Target → 3. Scope Gate →
4. Intake → 5. Distill → 6. Draft → 7. Review Gate → 8. Save →
9. Register → 10. Handoff

Throughout this skill, `<SKILL_ROOT>` and `<SHARED_REF_DIR>` are
placeholders that resolve from the chosen target — see
[skill-locations.md](../../_shared/references/skill-locations.md) for
the prefix table.

## 0. Brief

Capture intent before any other action. Write
`.briefs/<primitive>.brief.md` from the user's intake (the slug is the
primitive name from Intake #1 — pre-fill from `$ARGUMENTS` if present,
otherwise ask now). Format follows
[brief-best-practices.md](../../_shared/references/brief-best-practices.md):
five required H2 sections (*User ask*, *So-what*, *Scope boundaries*,
*Planned artifacts*, *Planned handoffs*) plus an empty *Decisions log*
appended-to throughout the workflow.

Pre-populate the two checklists from the planned workflow:

- **Planned artifacts** — the five files produced by Step 8 Save:
  principles doc, both SKILL.mds, audit-dimensions.md,
  repair-playbook.md (plus `primitive-routing.md` diff for plugin
  target).
- **Planned handoffs** — `/build:check-skill-pair`,
  `/build:check-skill` on each half, and (conditional on the check
  half needing Tier-1 scripts) `/build:build-bash-script` or
  `/build:build-python-script` per *Language Selection* in
  `primitive-routing.md`.

If `.briefs/<primitive>.brief.md` already exists, read it and ask
whether to update (default yes) or abandon and recreate (default no).
Update means: append to *Decisions log*, refresh checklists if scope
materially changed, retain *User ask* and *So-what* unless the user
explicitly revises them. Do not overwrite the brief silently.

## 1. Route

Confirm the user wants a *pair*, not a single skill. Single skills
route to `/build:build-skill`; auditing an existing pair routes to
`/build:check-skill` on each half. If the principles doc already
exists at `<SHARED_REF_DIR>/<primitive>-best-practices.md`, Distill
becomes a pass-through — read the existing doc and proceed to Draft
without regenerating.

## 2. Target

Pick the placement scope before any path-dependent step.
[skill-locations.md](../../_shared/references/skill-locations.md)
defines three targets — `plugin`, `project`, `user` — and the prefix
each one resolves to. Resolution rule:

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` carries a `--target <plugin|project|user>` flag,
   use it. Otherwise apply the inference rule from skill-locations.md
   (CWD walk-up: plugin source tree → project `.claude/` → user
   fallback).
2. Surface the resolved target to the user with the resolved
   `<SKILL_ROOT>` and `<SHARED_REF_DIR>`. Wait for explicit
   confirmation before continuing — inference is a default, not a
   commitment.
3. The Register step (#9) is required for `plugin` and optional for
   `project` / `user` per the routing-doc rule in
   skill-locations.md.

## 3. Scope Gate

Refuse — and recommend an alternative — when any of these signal:

1. **Primitive already has a pair.** If
   `<SKILL_ROOT>/build-<primitive>/` exists at the resolved target,
   stop. Offer to revise the existing pair (run `/build:check-skill`
   on both halves and iterate from findings) instead of scaffolding
   over it.
2. **No best-practice material at all.** Distillation needs raw
   material. The skill's value is synthesis, not invention —
   scaffolding without input produces a rubric indistinguishable
   from the model's defaults. Material can be files, URLs, pasted
   text, or the model's own named domain knowledge — but *something*
   must seed the distillation.
3. **Name collides with a core Claude Code primitive.** `skill`,
   `rule`, `hook`, `subagent`, and their existing
   `build-*`/`check-*` counterparts are owned. A pair for
   `build-skill` does not make sense — the pair pattern is *for*
   creating primitives like these, not re-creating them.

If any signal fires, state the signal, name the alternative, and
stop. Do not proceed to Intake.

## 4. Intake

If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, parse it as `[primitive-name]` and
pre-fill question 1. Otherwise ask, one question at a time:

**1. Primitive name** — kebab-case noun or noun-phrase
(`terraform-module`, `dockerfile`, `sql-migration`,
`github-action-workflow`). Avoid vague tokens (`config`, `thing`,
`helper`).

**2. One-sentence definition** — what the primitive is and what it
does. Used verbatim in the principles doc's opening paragraph and as
the description seed for both skills.

**3. Scope boundary** — what the primitive is *not*. This becomes the
Scope Gate signals in `build-<primitive>` and the refusal criteria in
`check-<primitive>`. Example: "bash-script is not POSIX `sh`, not a
Claude Code hook, not a multi-file application."

**4. Best-practice material** — enumerate the input to distillation.
Any mix of:

- **Local file paths** — e.g., `docs/style/python.md`, or an existing
  principles doc to extend
- **URLs** — fetched via WebFetch (e.g., Google Shell Style Guide,
  PEP 8, HashiCorp Terraform conventions)
- **Pasted text excerpts** — book chapters, internal docs, blog posts
- **Named model knowledge** — e.g., "Claude's knowledge of Kubernetes
  manifest best practices."

Provenance does not survive into the distilled doc — git history
(the PR or the commit that landed the pair) is where that lives.
This intake is purely raw material for the Distill step.

**5. Routing-doc placement** *(plugin target only — skip otherwise)* — does the new primitive belong as:

- **A new top-level primitive class** (new category alongside rules,
  hooks, skills, subagents, scripts) → append a paragraph to
  *What Each Primitive Was Designed For* and a branch to *Routing
  Test*.
- **A variant of an existing class** (e.g., a new script language
  alongside bash-script and python-script) → extend the relevant
  sub-section (usually *Language Selection*).

If unclear, read
[primitive-routing.md](../../_shared/references/primitive-routing.md)
and propose a placement; confirm with the user.

## 5. Distill

Re-read the brief's *So-what* before drafting the rubric. The
distilled doc must read as specific to the brief's intent — generic
"best practices for X" framing is the lossy-compression failure mode
the brief exists to counter.

For each piece of input material from Intake #4: extract patterns
*and the rationale behind each*. Patterns without rationale are
cargo-culting; refuse to carry them into the rubric.

Reconcile conflicts. When two inputs disagree — say, one recommends
2-space indent and another 4-space — pick a winner deliberately. The
resolution does not need to be recorded in the distilled doc (git
history carries that); what matters is that the final rubric is
internally consistent.

Produce `<SHARED_REF_DIR>/<primitive>-best-practices.md` with this
structure:

```
---
name: <Title-Case Primitive> Best Practices
description: Authoring guide for <primitive> — ... Referenced by build-<primitive> and check-<primitive>.
---

# <Title-Case Primitive> Best Practices

## What a Good <Primitive> Does
<narrative: value proposition, when it earns its place, scope>

## Anatomy
<canonical template with inline comments naming each part>

## Patterns That Work
<positive patterns, each with a one-line rationale>

## Anti-Patterns
<what to avoid, with the failure mode named — not "don't do X" but
"X fails because Y">

## Safety & Maintenance
<how to keep the primitive honest over time>
```

## 6. Draft (five artifacts)

Re-read the brief's *So-what* and *Scope boundaries* before drafting
the audit dimensions. Audit dimensions inherited from defaults
(rather than from the principles distilled at intake) are the
primary intra-skill drift symptom.

Produce all five before the Review Gate — present them together so the
user sees the whole pair. Tick each item in *Planned artifacts* off
in `.briefs/<primitive>.brief.md` as it is drafted.

**Artifact 1 — Principles doc.** Output of Step 4.

**Artifact 2 — `build-<primitive>/SKILL.md`.** Workflow template:
Route → Scope Gate → Elicit → Draft → Safety Check → Review Gate →
Save → Test (handoff to `check-<primitive>`). Frontmatter `references:`
includes the principles doc and `primitive-routing.md`. The body cites
the principles doc as "the rubric"; the skill body is "the workflow."

**Artifact 3 — `check-<primitive>/SKILL.md`.** Workflow template:
Route → Scope → Deterministic Checks (if applicable; Tier-1 shell
scripts under `scripts/`) → Judgment Checks (Tier-2 against
`audit-dimensions.md`) → Cross-Entity (Tier-3, if scope is a directory)
→ Report → Opt-In Repair Loop (handoff to `repair-playbook.md`).
Frontmatter `references:` includes the principles doc,
`audit-dimensions.md`, and `repair-playbook.md`.

**Artifact 4 — `check-<primitive>/references/audit-dimensions.md`.**
One entry per dimension with these fields: *name*, *what it checks*,
*pass criteria*, *fail criteria*, *severity*, *principles-doc section
it enforces*. Group into Structure / Safety / Documentation (or
primitive-appropriate groups).

**Artifact 5 — `check-<primitive>/references/repair-playbook.md`.**
One entry per dimension: *finding* → *diagnosis* → *fix recipe*
(code snippet or prose). The repair playbook is what turns an audit
finding into a pull request; it must be concrete, not advisory.

## 7. Review Gate

Present all five artifacts plus — for `plugin` target — the proposed
diff to `primitive-routing.md`. Wait for explicit user approval before
writing any file. If the user requests changes, revise and re-present
— continue until the user approves or cancels. Proceed to Save only on
explicit approval.

**Checklist verification.** Before accepting the build, read
`.briefs/<primitive>.brief.md` and confirm every item in *Planned
artifacts* is checked off. Unchecked items are a Review-Gate fail —
either the artifact was forgotten, or scope changed and the brief
needs updating with a *Decisions log* entry justifying the drop.
*Planned handoffs* may remain unchecked here; those land in Step 10.

This gate exists because five new files (plus a routing-doc change in
plugin mode) is a large commit to land silently. The user needs to
see the whole shape, not just the parts.

## 8. Save

Resolve the five paths against the target chosen in Step 2 and write:

- `<SHARED_REF_DIR>/<primitive>-best-practices.md`
- `<SKILL_ROOT>/build-<primitive>/SKILL.md`
- `<SKILL_ROOT>/check-<primitive>/SKILL.md`
- `<SKILL_ROOT>/check-<primitive>/references/audit-dimensions.md`
- `<SKILL_ROOT>/check-<primitive>/references/repair-playbook.md`

Do not `chmod` — these are markdown. Tier-1 deterministic-check
scripts under `check-<primitive>/scripts/` are out of scope here —
this skill scaffolds the SKILL.md contract and the rubric, not the
scripts that enforce deterministic dimensions. Route those to the
script-building skills; see the Handoff for the dogfooding rule.

## 9. Register

**Plugin target** — required. Update
`<SHARED_REF_DIR>/primitive-routing.md`:

- **New top-level primitive class** — add a one-paragraph entry under
  *What Each Primitive Was Designed For* and extend the *Routing Test*
  with the case the primitive resolves.
- **Variant of an existing class** — add to the relevant sub-section
  (most commonly *Language Selection* for new script languages).
- **In both cases** — add route lines to the section bottom:
  `/build:build-<primitive>` and `/build:check-<primitive>`.

The diff was presented at the Review Gate; write it now.

A pair that's not in `primitive-routing.md` is discoverable only by
grep — the routing doc is how other skills and future authors find
the new primitive. Skipping this step (in plugin mode) is how pairs
become orphans.

**Project / user target** — optional. If
`<SHARED_REF_DIR>/primitive-routing.md` exists at the resolved scope,
update it the same way. If not, skip with an informational note in the
handoff: project- and user-scoped pairs are still discoverable through
Claude Code's normal skill loader.

## 10. Handoff

Offer the audit:

> "Run `/build:check-skill <SKILL_ROOT>/build-<name>/SKILL.md`
> and `/build:check-skill <SKILL_ROOT>/check-<name>/SKILL.md`
> to audit both halves?"

Also flag follow-on work the user may want: bumping the build plugin
version, adding the pair to the plugin's skill list in `AGENTS.md`,
and — if the check half needs Tier-1 deterministic scripts — dogfood
the script-building skills to scaffold them. **Route language choice
through the *Language Selection* section of
[primitive-routing.md](../../_shared/references/primitive-routing.md):**
use `/build:build-bash-script` for genuine glue of CLI tools, or
`/build:build-python-script` for anything touching structured data,
testable seams, or logic beyond a one-liner. The tiebreaker in that
section — Python wins on interpretability — applies here too. This
skill is meta-infrastructure; it does not get to bypass its own
routing.

**Paste-excerpt handoff.** When invoking
`/build:build-bash-script` or `/build:build-python-script`, paste the
brief's *So-what* paragraph and the specific audit dimension the
script will enforce directly into the leaf skill's invocation prompt
— verbatim, not as a `.briefs/<primitive>.brief.md` pointer. Leaf
skills do not navigate to the brief; the semantic frame must travel
with the prompt. Tick the corresponding item in *Planned handoffs*
off as each leaf invocation completes.

## Example

Invocation: `/build:build-skill-pair terraform-module`

Intake (pre-filled primitive name):

- Definition: "a reusable Terraform module — a directory of `.tf`
  files with `main.tf` / `variables.tf` / `outputs.tf` exposing a
  single resource abstraction consumed via `module` blocks."
- Scope boundary: "not a root configuration, not a Terragrunt stack,
  not a provider."
- Input material: HashiCorp's module composition guide (URL), the
  in-repo `docs/style/terraform.md` (file), and Claude's knowledge of
  Terraform module conventions (named knowledge).
- Routing-doc placement: new top-level primitive class.

Output: five files plus a routing-doc diff adding a paragraph under
*What Each Primitive Was Designed For* and appending
`/build:build-terraform-module` / `/build:check-terraform-module`.

## Anti-Pattern Guards

1. **Scaffolding without input material.** Distill is synthesis,
   not invention. If Intake #4 yields nothing, stop and ask for
   material — don't manufacture a rubric from model defaults and
   ship it as "distilled best practices."
2. **Skipping the Register step.** A pair that isn't in
   `primitive-routing.md` is discoverable only by grep. Registration
   is not optional — it is how the pair becomes a first-class
   citizen.
3. **Build without check (or vice versa).** The pair is the unit. If
   the user only wants a scaffolder, route to `/build:build-skill`;
   if only an auditor, route there too and hand-write the principles
   doc. Scaffolding one half alone with this skill produces a
   dangling rubric nothing references.
4. **Writing before Review Gate approval.** Five files plus a routing
   diff is a large drop. Present the whole shape first; write only
   after explicit approval.
5. **Inlining a chained skill instead of invoking it.** MUST invoke
   `/build:<chained-skill>` via the Skill tool. MUST NOT read its
   SKILL.md and inline a partial implementation. The shortcut bypasses
   the chained skill's rubric and leaves no audit trail that the
   proper skill was used.

## Key Instructions

- Won't scaffold over an existing pair — Scope Gate signal #1 applies
  without exception. Offer to revise instead.
- Won't produce a principles doc from zero input material — Scope
  Gate signal #2 applies. Any mix of files, URLs, pasted text, or
  named model knowledge clears the gate; *nothing* does not.
- Won't write any of the five files — or the routing-doc diff —
  until the Review Gate passes.
- Principles doc lives in `_shared/references/`, not inside either
  skill directory. Both halves reference it at the same path so
  creation and review stay aligned.
- Won't hand-scaffold Tier-1 deterministic scripts — route to
  `/build:build-bash-script` or `/build:build-python-script` per
  *Language Selection* in `primitive-routing.md`. The meta-skill
  dogfoods the routing it helps maintain; authoring scripts inline
  would bypass the rubric this skill's whole design tells users to
  respect.
- Recovery if the pair is scaffolded in error: `rm -rf
  <SKILL_ROOT>/build-<name>/ <SKILL_ROOT>/check-<name>/
  <SHARED_REF_DIR>/<name>-best-practices.md` and revert the
  `primitive-routing.md` change (plugin mode). The artifacts are
  self-contained (no settings.json entries, no shared-module
  registration beyond the routing doc), so removal leaves no dangling
  state.

## Handoff

**Receives:** primitive name, one-sentence definition, scope boundary,
best-practice input material (files / URLs / pasted text /
named-model-knowledge), and a routing-doc placement decision (new
top-level class or variant of an existing class).

**Produces:** five files at the chosen target — the distilled
principles doc under `<SHARED_REF_DIR>/`, `build-<primitive>/SKILL.md`,
`check-<primitive>/SKILL.md`,
`check-<primitive>/references/audit-dimensions.md`, and
`check-<primitive>/references/repair-playbook.md`. In `plugin` mode,
also produces an updated `primitive-routing.md`. In `project` /
`user` mode, the routing-doc update is skipped unless one already
exists at the chosen scope.

**Chainable to:** `/build:check-skill-pair <primitive>` for
pair-level integrity (principles doc present, audit/playbook
dimension coverage, routing registration, shared principles path);
`/build:check-skill` on each of the two new SKILL.md files (catches
per-SKILL.md structural issues the Draft step missed);
`/build:build-bash-script` or `/build:build-python-script` when
Tier-1 deterministic scripts are needed — language picked per
*Language Selection* in `primitive-routing.md`, then audited via
`/build:check-bash-script` or `/build:check-python-script`.
