# Add Handoff Contracts to All Skills

**Goal:** Add a `## Handoff` section to all 14 existing SKILL.md files. Each section declares what the skill receives as input, what it produces as output, and which skills it naturally chains to. This makes chain design and audit tractable — `/wos:audit-chain` (Task 11) requires these contracts before it can verify chain consistency.

**Scope:**

Must have:
- `## Handoff` section in all 14 existing SKILL.md files
- All three fields present in each: `**Receives:**`, `**Produces:**`, `**Chainable to:**`
- Chainable-to values reference only valid existing skill names (or `—` for terminal)
- `python scripts/lint.py --root .` passes with no new warnings

Won't have:
- Changes to any non-SKILL.md files
- New skills (those come in Tasks 10–14 of the roadmap)
- New lint validation logic checking Handoff presence (that's in `wos/chain.py`, Task 9)
- Content changes to existing skill workflow or instruction text

**Approach:** Append a `## Handoff` section to each SKILL.md. Content is derived from each skill's existing workflow description and the chain table in issue #222. Skills are grouped into two logical chunks — the delivery chain and the knowledge/utility skills — each committed separately to create rollback boundaries. No code changes required.

**File Changes:**
- Modify: `skills/brainstorm/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/write-plan/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/execute-plan/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/validate-work/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/finish-work/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/research/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/distill/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/refine-prompt/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/lint/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/setup/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/check-rules/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/extract-rules/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)
- Modify: `skills/retrospective/SKILL.md` (add `## Handoff`)

**Branch:** `feat/skill-refresh`
**PR:** TBD

## Validation

- [ ] Each Handoff section contains all three fields: `**Receives:**`, `**Produces:**`, `**Chainable to:**`
- [ ] `grep -c "## Handoff" skills/*/SKILL.md | grep -v ":1"` — empty output (exactly one section per file)

## Notes

- This plan is part of the `feat/skill-refresh` branch shared with Task 7 (skill refresh against v0.35.0 research). Task 7 must follow this task on the same branch.
- `distill` is not in the issue #222 chain table but exists on disk and must have a Handoff section per the acceptance criteria ("all SKILL.md files").
- `check-rules` and `extract-rules` are slated for deprecation in v0.38.0 (Task 12) but still exist and need contracts now.
- `retrospective` is also slated for deprecation in v0.38.0 (Task 15) but needs a contract for the same reason.
