# Domain Context Pipelines

**Goal:** Build comprehensive domain context for WOS by running a
research-distill pipeline for each of 36 knowledge domains. The resulting
context files in `docs/context/` provide the analytical baseline for
systematic codebase review and improvement prioritization.

**Scope:**

Must have:
- One context file per domain in `docs/context/` (36 files total)
- Each context file follows WOS conventions (frontmatter, 200-800 words, one concept per file)
- Research documents in `docs/research/` backing each context file
- Foundational domains researched first so later domains can reference them

Won't have:
- Code changes or implementation improvements (context only)
- Codebase review or issue filing (that's Phases 4-7 of the pipeline prompt)
- Merging or PR creation (deferred to pipeline completion)

**Approach:** Execute 36 research-distill pipelines grouped into 10 chunks
by category. Each task runs `/wos:research` (landscape or technical mode)
for a domain, then `/wos:distill` to produce a context file. Chunks are
sequenced so foundational topics (LLM Foundations, Agent Architecture) come
first — later domains can reference earlier context files. Domains within
a chunk are independent and eligible for parallel execution.

**File Changes:**
- Create: `docs/research/` — 36 research documents (one per domain)
- Create: `docs/context/` — 36 context files (one per domain)
- Modify: `docs/context/_index.md` — updated by reindex after each chunk

**Branch:** `feat/recursive-research-to-enhancment-pipeline`
**PR:** TBD

- [ ] Run `/wos:research` (landscape mode): How AI coding tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex CLI, Cline, Aider) handle project context, instruction files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .github/copilot-instructions.md, AGENTS.md), tool invocation, and skill/command systems. Map the common patterns and divergences.
- [ ] Run `/wos:distill` to produce `docs/context/ai-coding-assistant-conventions.md`
- [ ] Verify: context file exists, has frontmatter (name, description), 200-800 words

### Task 34: Research & distill — Cross-Model Prompt Portability

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/research/cross-model-prompt-portability.md`
- Create: `docs/context/cross-model-prompt-portability.md`

- [ ] Run `/wos:research` (technical mode): How instruction styles, formatting preferences, and reasoning patterns differ across model families — Claude (XML tags), GPT/Codex (Markdown, system messages), Gemini (mixed), Llama/open-source (prompt sensitivity). What's universal vs. model-specific. Include benchmarks on format effects.

## Chunk 10: Meta / Philosophy

Cross-cutting design philosophies that constrain all other decisions.
Can run in parallel with Chunks 5-9.

### Task 35: Research & distill — Scope Management & YAGNI

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/research/scope-management-yagni.md`
- Create: `docs/context/scope-management-yagni.md`

- [ ] Run `/wos:research` (technical mode): How to resist feature creep in agent tooling — every field, abstraction, and feature must justify itself. The tool vs. framework spectrum. Include XP/lean perspectives, complexity budgets, and how YAGNI applies differently when the consumer is an LLM.
- [ ] Run `/wos:distill` to produce `docs/context/scope-management-yagni.md`
- [ ] Verify: context file exists, has frontmatter (name, description), 200-800 words

### Task 36: Research & distill — Reads vs. Writes Separation

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/research/reads-vs-writes-separation.md`
- Create: `docs/context/reads-vs-writes-separation.md`

- [ ] Run `/wos:research` (technical mode): The architectural pattern of separating observation from mutation in agent systems — CQRS parallels, why agents that silently "fix" things are dangerous, safety architecture for automated systems. Include examples from infrastructure automation and database design.
- [ ] Run `/wos:distill` to produce `docs/context/reads-vs-writes-separation.md`

## Validation

- [ ] All 36 context files exist in `docs/context/` with valid frontmatter (name, description fields present)
- [ ] All 36 research documents exist in `docs/research/` with valid frontmatter
- [ ] Each context file is 200-800 words
- [ ] `uv run scripts/audit.py --root . --no-urls` — no failures for new files
- [ ] `uv run scripts/reindex.py --root .` — indexes regenerated successfully
- [ ] Each context file's `related` field links back to its research document
