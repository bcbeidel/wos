## Summary

Agent-driven development introduces new demands on git workflows: agents produce
commits at machine speed, operate in parallel, and lack the social awareness that
makes team git conventions self-enforcing. This investigation covers seven
dimensions of git workflow integration, from commit granularity through CI/CD
gates. The core findings:

- **Commits as rollback boundaries** require atomic, single-concern commits with
  conventional commit messages. `git revert` is the only safe rollback mechanism
  for shared branches; `git reset` is appropriate only for local agent cleanup
  before push (HIGH).
- **Branch naming conventions** are converging on agent-prefixed patterns
  (`agent/<tool>/<task-slug>`) that make agent work visible, filterable, and
  automatable. GitHub Copilot enforces `copilot/` prefixes; teams should adopt
  analogous conventions (HIGH).
- **PR automation** via `gh` CLI and GitHub Actions enables agents to create PRs
  with structured metadata, but human review remains a mandatory gate. GitHub
  Agentic Workflows (2026 technical preview) formalize this with safe outputs
  and sandboxed execution (HIGH).
- **Git worktrees** have emerged as the dominant isolation pattern for parallel
  agent work, giving each agent its own working directory while sharing a single
  `.git` directory. Tools like Worktrunk and ccswarm automate worktree lifecycle
  management (HIGH).
- **Conventional Commits** are well-suited for agent-produced code because the
  format is mechanical and enforceable. Combined with commitlint and
  semantic-release, they enable fully automated versioning pipelines (HIGH).
- **CI/CD interaction** requires that agent-produced code pass identical checks
  to human code. Branch protection rules, required status checks, and CodeQL
  scanning apply uniformly. Agentic workflows complement but do not replace
  deterministic CI/CD (MODERATE -- tooling is early).

## Findings

### 1. Commits as Rollback Boundaries

The fundamental requirement for agent-produced commits is that each commit
represents a reversible unit of work. This means commits must be **atomic**
(one logical change per commit) and **self-contained** (the codebase is in a
valid state after each commit).

**Why granularity matters for agents.** Human developers naturally batch related
changes. Agents, operating at machine speed, can produce either extremely
fine-grained commits (every file save) or extremely coarse commits (entire
feature in one commit). Neither extreme serves rollback needs. The target is
one commit per logical change: a function addition, a test suite, a
configuration update [9].

**Rollback mechanisms.** Two git operations handle rollback, and they have
fundamentally different safety profiles:

- `git revert <sha>` creates a new commit that inverts the target commit's
  changes. History is preserved. This is the only safe option for shared
  branches where other developers (or agents) may have pulled the commit [12].
- `git reset --hard <sha>` moves the branch pointer backward, discarding
  commits. This rewrites history and requires `--force` push. It is appropriate
  only for local agent cleanup before any push -- for example, an agent
  discarding its own failed attempt before trying again [12].

**Practical pattern for agent rollback:**

```
# Agent completes task, pushes 3 commits
agent/auth-feature: A -> B -> C

# Commit C introduced a bug; revert it
git revert C
# Result: A -> B -> C -> C'  (C' inverts C)

# Commits B and C were both wrong; revert range
git revert B..C
# Result: A -> B -> C -> C' -> B'
```

**Confidence:** HIGH -- `git revert` as the safe rollback mechanism for shared
branches is established git practice [12], and atomic commits as the
prerequisite for clean reverts is well-documented across all sources.

**Counter-evidence:** Some agent workflows use `git reset --hard` followed by
force-push on agent-owned branches, arguing that since no human has pulled the
branch, history rewriting is safe. This is valid only when branch ownership is
strictly enforced and the branch has not been used as a base for other work.

### 2. Branch Naming Conventions

Agent-produced branches need to be distinguishable from human branches for
filtering, CI routing, cleanup automation, and audit trails. Three patterns
have emerged:

**Pattern A: Agent-type prefix (dominant)**
```
agent/claude/add-auth-middleware
agent/copilot/fix-null-check
bot/dependabot/upgrade-lodash
```
GitHub Copilot enforces this pattern -- agents can only push to branches
starting with `copilot/` [4]. This restriction prevents agents from
accidentally pushing to protected branches and makes agent work instantly
filterable.

**Pattern B: Ticket-linked agent prefix**
```
ai/PROJ-123/claude
ai/PROJ-456/copilot-fix
```
Links agent work to specific issue tracking, providing traceability from
branch to ticket to PR [10].

**Pattern C: Conventional Branch (emerging standard)**
```
feat/agent/add-user-auth
fix/agent/null-pointer-check
```
Mirrors Conventional Commits type prefixes in branch names, enabling CI to
infer the nature of changes from the branch name alone.

**Recommended convention for teams:**
```
<type>/<agent-name>/<task-slug>
feat/claude/add-auth-middleware
fix/claude/resolve-race-condition
```

This combines the benefits of all three patterns: the type prefix enables CI
routing and conventional commit alignment, the agent name provides attribution
and filtering, and the task slug provides human-readable context.

**Automation support.** Branch naming can be enforced through:
- Git hooks (pre-push) that validate branch name format
- GitHub branch protection rules with name pattern requirements
- CI checks that reject PRs from non-conforming branches
- Agent configuration that templates branch names from task descriptions

**Confidence:** HIGH -- the agent-prefix pattern is established practice (GitHub
Copilot enforces it [4]), and Conventional Branch naming is gaining adoption [10].

### 3. PR Automation

Agents can create PRs programmatically using `gh pr create`, but the PR must
carry sufficient metadata for human reviewers to evaluate agent-produced changes
efficiently.

**Required PR metadata for agent-generated PRs:**

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Title | Conventional commit-style summary | `feat: add JWT authentication middleware` |
| Body | Structured description with context | Summary, changes list, test plan |
| Labels | Agent attribution + change type | `agent:claude`, `type:feature` |
| Reviewers | Auto-assigned based on CODEOWNERS | Team or individual reviewers |
| Draft status | Agent indicates confidence level | Draft = needs iteration, Ready = confident |

**GitHub Agentic Workflows (2026 technical preview)** formalize the
agent-to-PR pipeline with a defense-in-depth security architecture [2][3]:

- **Read-only by default:** Agent workflows run with read-only permissions.
  Write operations (creating PRs, commenting, pushing) require explicit
  approval through "safe outputs" -- pre-approved, reviewable GitHub
  operations.
- **Sandboxed execution:** Agents operate in isolated environments with tool
  allowlisting and network isolation.
- **Human approval gate:** Agents cannot approve or merge their own PRs.
  A human must review and merge.

**PR creation pattern with `gh` CLI:**

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: add JWT auth middleware" \
  --body "## Summary
- Added JWT middleware for API routes
- Includes token validation and refresh logic

## Agent Context
- Agent: claude-code
- Task: PROJ-123
- Confidence: high
- Commits: 3 (atomic, each tested)

## Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual review of auth flow" \
  --label "agent:claude" \
  --reviewer "@team/backend"
```

**AI-powered PR review tools** like Qodo's PR-Agent [11] can review
agent-generated PRs, creating a two-layer review: AI reviews AI code, then
human reviews both. This catches pattern-level issues that humans might miss
in large PRs while preserving human judgment for architectural decisions.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- `gh pr create` is stable tooling, GitHub Agentic
Workflows are in official technical preview [2][3], and the metadata patterns
are well-established.

### 4. Git Worktree Patterns

Git worktrees allow multiple working directories to share a single `.git`
directory, each checked out to a different branch. This has become the dominant
isolation pattern for parallel agent work [1].

**Core mechanics:**

```bash
# Create a worktree for an agent task
git worktree add ../project-auth-feature -b agent/claude/auth-feature

# Agent works in ../project-auth-feature independently
# Main working directory remains on its current branch

# List active worktrees
git worktree list

# Clean up after merge
git worktree remove ../project-auth-feature
```

**Why worktrees beat alternatives for agent isolation:**

| Approach | Isolation | Disk cost | Merge complexity | Shared history |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Separate clones | Full | High (full repo copy) | High (remote sync) | No |
| Branch switching | None | Zero | Low | Yes |
| **Worktrees** | **Directory-level** | **Low (shared .git)** | **Low (same repo)** | **Yes** |
| Containers | Full + runtime | Very high | High | No |

**Tooling for worktree management:**

**Worktrunk** [7] is a Rust CLI that simplifies worktree lifecycle for agent
workflows. Core commands: `wt switch`, `wt list`, `wt merge`, `wt remove`.
It supports post-start hooks for dependency installation and dev server
startup, and addresses worktrees by branch name rather than path.

```bash
# Create worktree and launch agent in one command
wt switch -x claude -c feature-auth -- 'Add user authentication'
```

**ccswarm** [8] is a multi-agent orchestration system that uses worktree
isolation with specialized agent pools (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, QA). Each
agent gets its own worktree, preventing file-level conflicts during parallel
execution.

**Limitations and pitfalls:**

- **One branch per worktree:** Git prohibits checking out the same branch in
  multiple worktrees. Each agent must use a unique branch.
- **Merge conflicts are deferred, not prevented:** Worktrees isolate during
  development, but conflicts surface at merge time. If two agents modify the
  same file, manual or AI-assisted resolution is needed.
- **Shared resources beyond git:** Worktrees share the database, Docker daemon,
  and cache directories. Two agents running migrations simultaneously creates
  race conditions.
- **Disk usage:** Each worktree contains a full working directory copy. For
  large repositories, 5-10 parallel worktrees can consume significant disk
  space.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- git worktrees are a stable git feature, and the agent
isolation pattern is documented across multiple independent sources [1][7][8].

### 5. Conventional Commits and Agent Code

The Conventional Commits specification [5] defines a structured format for
commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types map to semantic versioning:**

| Type | SemVer bump | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `fix` | PATCH | `fix(auth): resolve token expiry race condition` |
| `feat` | MINOR | `feat(api): add user profile endpoint` |
| `feat!` or `BREAKING CHANGE` footer | MAJOR | `feat!: redesign auth API` |
| `docs`, `chore`, `ci`, `test`, `refactor` | No release | `test: add auth middleware unit tests` |

**Why agents are well-suited to conventional commits.** The format is
mechanical and rule-based -- exactly the kind of task LLMs handle reliably.
An agent can:
1. Analyze the diff to determine the change type (fix, feat, refactor)
2. Identify the scope from the files changed
3. Generate a description summarizing the change
4. Add a body explaining the reasoning
5. Include footers for breaking changes or issue references

**Enforcement toolchain:**

```
commitlint (local hook) → husky (git hook runner) → semantic-release (CI)
```

- **commitlint** + **husky**: Pre-commit hook validates message format. If an
  agent produces a non-conforming message, the commit is rejected and the agent
  must retry [local enforcement].
- **semantic-release** [6]: CI tool that reads conventional commit history,
  determines the next version, generates changelogs, and publishes releases.
  This creates a fully automated pipeline: agent writes conventional commits
  -> CI determines version bump -> release is published automatically.

**Agent-specific commit metadata.** Teams can extend conventional commits with
trailers to attribute agent work:

```
feat(auth): add JWT validation middleware

Implement token validation with RS256 signature verification.
Includes refresh token rotation and configurable expiry.

Agent: claude-code
Task: PROJ-123
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

The `Co-Authored-By` trailer is a GitHub-recognized format that attributes
the commit to both the agent and the human who initiated the task.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- Conventional Commits v1.0.0 is a stable specification [5],
and the enforcement toolchain (commitlint, semantic-release) is mature [6].

### 6. CI/CD Interaction with Agent-Produced Code

Agent-produced code must pass through identical CI/CD gates as human-produced
code. The principle is **equal scrutiny, not special treatment.**

**Required CI checks for agent PRs:**

| Check | Purpose | Tooling |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Unit tests | Correctness | pytest, jest, etc. |
| Integration tests | System behavior | Test frameworks + fixtures |
| Linting | Code style | ruff, eslint, etc. |
| Type checking | Type safety | mypy, tsc, etc. |
| Security scanning | Vulnerability detection | CodeQL, Snyk, Dependabot |
| Commit message format | Conventional commits | commitlint GitHub Action |
| Branch name format | Naming convention | Custom CI check |
| Code coverage | Regression detection | Coverage tools + thresholds |

**Branch protection rules** enforce these checks:
- Require PR before merging (no direct push to main)
- Require at least one human approval
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up-to-date with base branch
- Require signed commits (optional, complex for agents)

**GitHub Agentic Workflows and CI/CD coexistence [2][3]:**

GitHub explicitly states that agentic workflows are **not intended to replace
deterministic CI/CD** but to complement it. The distinction:

- **CI/CD (deterministic):** Build, test, lint, deploy. Must produce identical
  results given identical inputs. Agent code passes through these pipelines
  like any other code.
- **Agentic workflows (non-deterministic):** Triage issues, update docs,
  investigate CI failures, suggest improvements. These augment the development
  process but do not gate releases.

**Copilot coding agent CI integration [4]:** When Copilot creates a PR, it
automatically runs CodeQL for security vulnerabilities, checks dependencies
against the GitHub Advisory Database, and uses secret scanning. If problems
are found, Copilot attempts to fix them before marking the PR ready.

**Agent-specific CI considerations:**

1. **Rate limiting:** Agents can produce PRs faster than CI can process them.
   Queue management and concurrency limits prevent CI overload.
2. **Flaky test handling:** Agents should not auto-retry on flaky tests without
   human guidance -- auto-retry can mask real failures introduced by agent code.
3. **Resource costs:** Each agent PR triggers a full CI run. Teams should
   consider whether agent PRs need full matrix testing or can use a fast-path
   subset initially.

**Confidence:** MODERATE -- the principle of equal CI treatment is
well-established, but GitHub Agentic Workflows are in early technical preview
(February 2026) [3], and best practices for CI interaction with high-volume
agent PRs are still evolving.

### 7. Compatibility with Team Git Workflows

Different team workflows present different integration points for agent
contributors.

**Trunk-based development:**
- Agents create short-lived feature branches and merge frequently
- Agent branches follow the same short-lived pattern as human branches
- Feature flags gate incomplete agent work from production
- Agents integrate well because trunk-based development already assumes
  frequent, small merges

**GitHub Flow:**
- Agents create feature branches from main, open PRs, get review, merge
- The PR review gate is the primary quality control for agent code
- Agent branches are visually distinguishable by naming convention
- No additional process changes needed beyond naming and metadata

**GitFlow:**
- More complex branch hierarchy creates more places for agents to conflict
- Agents should only create feature branches from develop, never touch
  release or hotfix branches without explicit human instruction
- The structured release process provides natural checkpoints for
  reviewing accumulated agent changes

**Recommended integration pattern (works with all workflows):**

1. Agent creates branch with naming convention: `<type>/<agent>/<slug>`
2. Agent makes atomic commits with conventional commit messages
3. Agent opens PR with structured metadata via `gh pr create`
4. CI runs all standard checks (same as human code)
5. Human reviews and merges (agent cannot self-merge)
6. If rollback needed, `git revert` on the merge commit

**Key constraint:** Agents must never push directly to protected branches.
All agent work flows through PRs with human approval. This is the
non-negotiable compatibility requirement across all team workflows.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- the pattern of branch + PR + review + merge is
universal across git workflows, and adding agent-specific naming and metadata
is additive, not disruptive.

## Challenge

**Are atomic commits realistic for agents?** Agents producing complex features
may struggle to decompose work into truly atomic commits without explicit
prompting. A feature implementation might naturally produce interleaved changes
across multiple files that are difficult to separate. Mitigation: agent
instructions should explicitly require commit decomposition, and pre-commit
hooks should enforce commit message format. The commit itself may not be
perfectly atomic, but the conventional commit message at least describes the
intended scope.

**Do worktrees scale?** For teams with many agents running simultaneously,
worktree management becomes an operational concern. Disk space, branch
proliferation, and merge conflict volume all scale with agent count. Tooling
like Worktrunk helps, but teams need policies for worktree cleanup and branch
pruning.

**Is the `copilot/` prefix pattern transferable?** GitHub enforces the
`copilot/` prefix for its own agent, but other agents (Claude Code, Cursor,
Codex) do not have platform-enforced prefixes. Teams must self-enforce
through hooks and CI checks, which requires discipline.

**Should CI treat agent PRs differently?** The finding says "equal scrutiny,"
but agent PRs may benefit from additional checks (e.g., diff size limits,
automated complexity analysis) or relaxed checks (e.g., skipping manual test
checklists that assume human context). This remains an open question.

**Conventional commits and semantic-release with agent volume:** If agents
produce many `feat` commits, semantic-release could bump versions rapidly.
Teams may need policies about squash-merging agent PRs to control version
velocity.

## Takeaways

**For teams adopting agent-driven development:**

1. **Start with naming and metadata.** Agent-prefixed branches and conventional
   commits are low-cost, high-value changes that make agent work visible and
   reversible without changing existing workflows.

2. **Enforce through automation, not policy.** Commitlint hooks, branch name
   validation in CI, and branch protection rules are more reliable than
   documentation asking agents to follow conventions.

3. **Use worktrees for parallel agents.** The pattern is proven and well-tooled.
   Accept that merge conflicts are deferred, not eliminated, and plan for
   integration testing.

4. **Keep CI identical.** Agent code passes through the same gates as human
   code. Add agent-specific metadata to PRs, not agent-specific CI paths.

5. **Revert, never reset, on shared branches.** `git revert` is the only safe
   rollback mechanism for commits that have been pushed. Agent instructions
   should encode this as an invariant.
