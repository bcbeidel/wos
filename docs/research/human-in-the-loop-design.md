## Summary

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) design determines when AI systems act autonomously and when they pause for human judgment. The foundational insight from decades of automation research is that this is not a binary choice but a spectrum, and the optimal point on that spectrum shifts with context, risk, and accumulated trust. Getting it wrong in either direction — too much autonomy causes automation bias and missed errors; too little autonomy creates bottleneck fatigue and disuse.

**Key findings:**

- **Automation is a spectrum, not a switch.** Sheridan and Verplank's 10-level taxonomy (1978) and Parasuraman, Sheridan, and Wickens' 4-function model (2000) establish that automation decisions should be made independently for information acquisition, analysis, decision selection, and action implementation (HIGH).
- **Automation bias is the dominant failure mode.** Users systematically over-rely on AI recommendations without independent verification, manifesting as both commission errors (following wrong advice) and omission errors (failing to act without AI prompting). Multiple studies across healthcare, aviation, and decision support confirm this pattern (HIGH).
- **Trust calibration requires active intervention.** Neither transparency alone nor experience alone produces appropriate reliance. Systems must provide confidence signals, verification prompts, and feedback on automation accuracy to calibrate trust (HIGH).
- **Gate on reversibility and consequence magnitude.** Irreversible actions, financial transactions, data sharing, and significant state changes require explicit approval; reversible, low-stakes actions can be automated with audit trails (HIGH).
- **Confidence-based routing reduces oversight burden without sacrificing safety.** Dynamic intervention frameworks that route only high-uncertainty decisions to humans (roughly 15% of total) maintain 98%+ success rates while cutting human workload by 65% (MODERATE).
- **Progressive autonomy builds trust.** Starting at full human review (audit mode), graduating to exception-based review (assist mode), and eventually reaching monitored autonomy (autopilot mode) matches the natural trust calibration cycle (MODERATE).

## Findings

### What frameworks exist for deciding when to require human approval vs. automate?

The foundational framework is Sheridan and Verplank's (1978) 10-level taxonomy of automation, which ranges from "the computer offers no assistance" (Level 1) to "the computer decides everything, acts autonomously, ignores the human" (Level 10) [3]. This was refined by Parasuraman, Sheridan, and Wickens (2000) into a two-dimensional model crossing four functional stages (information acquisition, information analysis, decision selection, action implementation) with levels of automation [3]. The key insight: automation decisions should not be made globally but separately for each function. A system might fully automate information gathering while requiring human approval for action implementation (HIGH — T1 sources converge, foundational framework widely adopted).

Modern agentic AI frameworks build on this foundation with three practical patterns [6][12]:

1. **Audit mode** (weeks 1-4): 100% human review. Builds accuracy baseline and initial trust.
2. **Assist mode**: Routine cases proceed autonomously; exceptions route to human review based on confidence thresholds.
3. **Autopilot mode**: Autonomous operation with human-on-the-loop monitoring and intervention capability.

The Dynamic Intervention Framework (DIF) introduces a Contextual Confidence Score that evaluates output probability and semantic alignment, routing only the most critical 14.5% of decisions to humans while maintaining 98.2% success rates on enterprise tasks [7]. This demonstrates that confidence-based filtering can balance autonomy and oversight effectively (MODERATE — single study, but quantitative results are specific).

**Decision criteria for gating on approval** [6][12]:
- **Irreversibility**: Actions that cannot be undone require approval gates
- **Consequence magnitude**: Financial transactions, data deletion, external communications
- **Scope boundaries**: Actions outside the agent's defined work scope
- **Confidence thresholds**: When system confidence drops below calibrated thresholds
- **Regulatory requirements**: EU AI Act Article 14 mandates human oversight for high-risk AI systems [8]

### What does the research say about automation bias and over-reliance?

Automation bias (AB) is the tendency to over-rely on automated recommendations, manifesting in two error types [4][5]:

- **Commission errors**: Following incorrect AI advice (accepting false positives)
- **Omission errors**: Failing to notice problems the AI doesn't flag (missing false negatives)

The Parasuraman and Riley (1997) framework identifies four human responses to automation [4]:
- **Use**: Appropriate engagement with automation
- **Misuse**: Over-reliance leading to monitoring failures and decision biases
- **Disuse**: Underutilization, often caused by false alarms eroding trust
- **Abuse**: Automating functions without regard for human performance consequences

Recent research (Romeo & Conti, 2025) finds that automation bias is driven by multiple interacting factors beyond simple over-trust: AI literacy, professional expertise, cognitive profile, developmental trust dynamics, task verification demands, and explanation complexity [5]. Critically, those with "intermediate" knowledge are most susceptible — enough familiarity to feel confident but insufficient depth to recognize AI limitations (HIGH — systematic review with convergent findings across domains).

The Explainable AI (XAI) paradox is a significant finding: while XAI mechanisms are designed to mitigate automation bias, overly technical or overly simplistic explanations can inadvertently reinforce misplaced trust, especially among less experienced users [5]. This means transparency is necessary but insufficient — it must be calibrated to the user's expertise level (MODERATE — emerging finding, limited replication).

In an LLM-based synthetic simulation examining cognitive biases in AI-mediated decision-making, 78% of simulated agents defaulted to AI-generated decisions without critical review — 51% attributable to automation bias, 19% to technology superiority bias, and 8% to confirmation bias. While synthetic rather than human-participant research, this directionally aligns with observed human behavior patterns (LOW — synthetic simulation, not empirical human study).

Healthcare research shows that AI false-positive suggestions affected radiologists' diagnoses, with inexperienced practitioners being more prone to commission errors while omission errors appeared across all experience levels [5] (HIGH — replicated across multiple medical imaging studies).

### How should decisions needing input be presented to users?

The Smashing Magazine (2026) framework for agentic AI UX identifies six patterns organized across three phases [6]:

**Pre-Action (Establishing Intent):**
- **Intent Preview**: Before significant actions, present a scannable summary of what the agent plans to do, showing planned steps, reversibility status, and edit controls. Options: "Proceed," "Edit," or "Handle it Myself." This pattern is non-negotiable for irreversible actions, financial transactions, data sharing, and significant state changes.
- **Autonomy Dial**: Let users define the agent's boundaries before action begins.

**In-Action (Providing Context):**
- **Explainable Rationale**: Collapsible reasoning panels or citations that let users dig deeper when needed without overwhelming them by default.
- **Confidence Signal**: Indicate how reliable the AI believes its output is, enabling users to gauge when to double-check. Avoid presenting every output as final.

**Post-Action (Safety and Recovery):**
- **Action Audit & Undo**: Full audit trail with undo capability as a safety net.
- **Escalation Pathway**: Clear mechanism for high-ambiguity moments to route to human expertise.

Key design principles for decision presentation (HIGH — practitioner consensus across multiple frameworks):
- **Inline review** over separate approval screens. Quick accept/reject/edit actions keep workflow smooth; separate approval screens feel like bureaucracy and promote disuse.
- **Right-sized explanation**. Too much detail is noise; too little erodes trust. Collapsible detail is the pattern.
- **Progressive disclosure of reasoning**. Show the conclusion first, make the reasoning available on demand.

### How is trust calibrated in human-AI teaming?

Lee and See's (2004) foundational model identifies three processes through which automation characteristics influence trust [2]:
- **Analytic**: Based on rational assessment of automation reliability and capability
- **Analogical**: Based on comparison to similar systems or past experience
- **Affective**: Based on emotional response to the automation's behavior

The National Academies (2022) report on Human-AI Teaming identifies two key challenges [1]:
1. Trust research environments need to specify the social structure of team decisions, moving beyond individual trust to team-level trust calibration
2. Interaction design needs to move toward directable and directive interactions, not just transparent and explainable ones

Trust miscalibration takes two forms [1][10]:
- **Over-trust**: Believing the AI will perform better than it actually does, leading to automation complacency and missed errors
- **Under-trust**: Believing the AI will perform worse than it actually does, leading to disuse and wasted capability

Research on adaptive trust calibration (Ma et al., 2020) proposes detecting inappropriate calibration by monitoring user reliance behavior and providing "trust calibration cues" — signals that adjust user trust toward the system's actual capability [10]. When AI systems include improved self-assessment and communicate their uncertainty, overall trust is more appropriate, over- and under-reliance behaviors decrease, and team performance increases (MODERATE — limited to controlled experiments).

Situational trust mediates between dispositional trust and actual reliance behavior. A user with high general trust in technology may still appropriately distrust a specific AI system if they receive adequate performance feedback [9] (MODERATE — single study with strong theoretical grounding).

The communication of AI confidence and uncertainty is the single most impactful trust calibration mechanism. Explicit display of correct likelihood information promotes appropriate trust behaviors more effectively than explanations of reasoning [9][10] (HIGH — convergent finding across multiple studies).

### What are the cost/benefit tradeoffs of autonomy at different levels?

The cost/benefit analysis of human oversight operates along several dimensions:

**Costs of excessive oversight:**
- Throughput bottleneck: Human review creates latency proportional to reviewer availability
- Decision fatigue: Reviewing routine correct outputs degrades reviewer attention for genuinely uncertain cases
- Disuse risk: When oversight feels like bureaucracy, users rubber-stamp or bypass it entirely
- Opportunity cost: Human attention spent on low-risk review is unavailable for high-value judgment

**Costs of excessive autonomy:**
- Error propagation: Unreviewed errors compound, especially in sequential workflows
- Trust erosion: A single significant autonomous error can cause users to distrust the entire system
- Regulatory exposure: EU AI Act and similar frameworks impose legal requirements for human oversight of high-risk systems [8]
- Automation bias amplification: Reduced oversight strengthens the tendency to accept AI outputs uncritically

**The hybrid optimum**: Manufacturing research found that hybrid models (AI handles routine tasks, humans focus on strategic decisions) deliver 40% greater ROI than either all-human or maximum-automation approaches. The Dynamic Intervention Framework demonstrates that routing only the highest-uncertainty 14.5% of decisions to humans maintains 98.2% success rates while reducing human workload by 65% [7] (MODERATE — limited to specific domains, but directionally consistent).

**Progressive autonomy model** [6][12]:
- **Level 1 (Audit)**: Full human review. High cost, high safety. Use for initial deployment or after trust-breaking incidents.
- **Level 2 (Assist)**: Exception-based review. Moderate cost, high safety. Sustainable steady-state for most applications.
- **Level 3 (Autopilot)**: Monitored autonomy. Low cost, moderate safety. Appropriate only after extended successful operation and for reversible actions.

The key insight: autonomy level should be dynamic, not fixed. Systems should tighten oversight after errors and loosen it after sustained success, matching the natural trust calibration cycle (MODERATE — theoretical framework with limited empirical validation of the dynamic adjustment).

### What practical design guidelines exist for HITL in agentic AI?

Synthesizing across frameworks, the following guidelines emerge:

**Gate criteria (require human approval when):**
1. Action is irreversible or difficult to reverse
2. Action involves financial transactions of any amount
3. Action shares information with external systems or people
4. Action makes changes the user cannot easily undo
5. System confidence is below calibrated threshold
6. Action falls outside the agent's defined scope
7. Regulatory requirements mandate human oversight

**Automate criteria (proceed without approval when):**
1. Action is easily reversible with undo capability
2. Action is within well-defined scope boundaries
3. System confidence exceeds calibrated threshold
4. Action type has established track record of accuracy
5. Audit trail captures the action for post-hoc review
6. Graceful degradation is available if the action fails

**Implementation patterns:**
- **Checkpoint architecture**: Pause at predefined points, present state, allow resume from exact checkpoint [12]
- **Tiered action classification**: Classify all possible actions by reversibility and consequence magnitude before deployment
- **Confidence-based routing**: Use contextual confidence scores to dynamically route decisions to human review [7]
- **Graceful escalation**: Agent pauses, presents current state to human, and resumes from that checkpoint [12]
- **Feedback loops**: Human decisions on escalated cases feed back into the system to improve future confidence calibration

**EU AI Act compliance requirements** (Article 14, effective August 2026) [8]:
- Users must understand system capabilities and limitations
- Users must be able to monitor operation and detect anomalies
- Users must be aware of automation bias tendencies
- Users must be able to correctly interpret system output
- Users must be able to decline to use the system or disregard its output in any situation

## Challenge

**Counter-evidence and limitations:**

1. **The oversight paradox**: Some researchers argue that human-in-the-loop creates a false sense of safety. When humans review AI outputs at scale, they tend toward rubber-stamping rather than genuine evaluation, making the "oversight" performative rather than functional. Research on automation complacency across aviation, healthcare, and process control consistently documents this pattern. HITL may be worse than full automation in some cases because it provides the illusion of oversight without the substance.

2. **Dynamic autonomy assumptions**: The progressive autonomy model assumes trust calibration is monotonic (steadily improving). In practice, trust can be brittle — a single failure after a long period of success may not merely reduce trust but shatter it entirely, requiring a full restart of the calibration process rather than a proportional adjustment.

3. **Confidence score reliability**: The DIF framework's confidence-based routing depends on the AI system's ability to accurately self-assess. Current LLMs are known to be poorly calibrated in their confidence estimates, and overconfident on wrong answers. Routing based on unreliable confidence scores could systematically filter out exactly the cases that most need human review.

4. **The XAI paradox generalization**: If transparency mechanisms can reinforce misplaced trust, then the standard recommendation to "show your reasoning" may be counterproductive for some user populations. There is no universal transparency level that works across expertise levels.

5. **Cost-benefit data limitations**: The 40% ROI improvement and 65% workload reduction figures come from limited domains. Generalizing these numbers to knowledge work, creative tasks, or safety-critical systems is unwarranted without domain-specific validation.
