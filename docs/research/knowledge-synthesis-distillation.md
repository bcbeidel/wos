## Summary

Knowledge distillation — compressing raw research into focused, actionable context — is a lossy compression problem. The core insight from information theory: you cannot compress without defining what counts as acceptable loss, and that definition depends on the downstream task.

**Key findings** (21 searches across 20 sources, all verified):

- **Compress relative to purpose, not uniformly.** The information bottleneck method (Tishby et al., 1999) formalizes this: relevant information is defined by what the compressed output needs to predict. For agent-facing documents, the "relevant variable" is the decision or action the agent will take. Content that does not inform agent behavior is compressible; content that does is not (HIGH).
- **Structure forces preservation.** Structured summarization with dedicated sections outperforms opaque compression (Factory.ai: 3.70 vs 3.35 quality score at similar compression ratios). Each section acts as a checklist the compressor must populate, preventing silent information drift (MODERATE).
- **Provenance belongs in a separate channel.** Citation references, source tables, and file path pointers add minimal tokens while maintaining traceability. Provenance is metadata about compressed content, not part of the content itself (HIGH).
- **Shorter is better for agents.** LLM performance drops >30% for mid-context information (Liu et al., 2024). Context rot degrades all 18 tested frontier models as input length grows (Chroma, 2025). Compression is not just cost reduction — it improves quality (HIGH).
- **20x compression is achievable with <2% quality loss.** LLMLingua (Microsoft, EMNLP 2023) retains reasoning capability at 20x compression with 1.5% performance loss. ACON (2025) lowers agent memory usage 26-54% while maintaining task performance (HIGH).

## Findings

### The Theoretical Foundation: Compression Is About Defining What Matters

Three information-theoretic frameworks provide the conceptual scaffolding for knowledge compression:

**Rate-distortion theory** establishes that lossy compression requires an explicit distortion measure — you cannot compress without defining what counts as acceptable loss [1]. The rate-distortion function R(D) formalizes the tradeoff: more compression means more distortion, and the relationship is bounded. For knowledge documents, you must define your distortion measure before compressing. Is losing a citation acceptable? A nuance? A specific number? Different answers produce different strategies (HIGH — T1 + T3 sources converge).

**The information bottleneck method** (Tishby et al., 1999) extends rate-distortion by introducing *relevant information* [2][5][6]. Rather than minimizing generic distortion, IB asks: what information in X is relevant to predicting Y? This reframes compression as task-dependent — you compress relative to a purpose. For research distillation, the "relevant variable Y" is the downstream decision or action the agent will take (HIGH — T1 + T3 sources).

**The minimum description length principle** frames compression as model selection: the best summary is the shortest description that captures the underlying regularities [3]. A good distillation extracts patterns and principles, not raw observations. MDL is sometimes called Occam's razor in mathematical form (HIGH — T1 source).

**Kolmogorov complexity** provides the theoretical floor: no compression beats the shortest program that generates the output [4]. Highly specific facts (names, dates, exact figures) resist compression more than patterns and generalizations (HIGH — T1 source).

**Limitation:** Shannon's original framework explicitly excludes semantics [19]. These theories operate on statistical properties of signals, not on meaning. They provide useful mental models and vocabulary for knowledge compression, but do not yield precise compression bounds for natural language documents (MODERATE — T3 source).

### Practical Distillation: What to Keep, What to Discard

Three approaches to research distillation, from most to least conservative:

**Extractive compression** selects salient sentences directly from source material without paraphrasing. Provenance is perfect — every sentence traces to its origin. The cost is limited compression ratio; you can only remove sentences, not reformulate. Best for preserving exact claims, quotes, and specific data (HIGH — multiple sources converge).

**Progressive summarization** (Forte, 2017) provides a multi-pass distillation technique [16]: capture raw notes (Layer 1), bold key phrases (Layer 2), highlight the best of the bolded (Layer 3), write a 1-2 sentence executive summary (Layer 4). Each layer leaves behind good-but-not-great content. Maps directly to agent-facing document construction: Layer 1 = raw research, Layer 4 = the frontmatter description field (MODERATE — T4 source, widely adopted).

**Abstractive compression** generates new formulations synthesizing across sources. Achieves highest compression ratios but introduces hallucination risk and makes attribution "particularly daunting" [18]. Hybrid approaches — extractive selection followed by abstractive paraphrasing — offer better provenance than pure abstraction (MODERATE — T3 sources).

**Practical heuristics from production systems:**

Keep:
- Decisions and their rationale (why, not just what) [9]
- Specific constraints, requirements, and stated goals [9][10]
- Key findings with confidence levels and source citations
- File paths, identifiers, and proper nouns (incompressible) [8]
- Counter-evidence and limitations (easily lost in summarization)

Discard:
- Exploratory dead ends and brainstorming once conclusions exist [9]
- Raw tool outputs when the conclusion is preserved [9][11]
- Redundant restatements and acknowledgements [9]
- Boilerplate, navigation, and formatting artifacts
- Intermediate reasoning steps once the final reasoning is captured

(HIGH — T1 + T4 sources converge; Factory.ai [8][9] and Manus [11] arrived at similar heuristics independently)

### Preserving Provenance Under Compression

Three mechanisms for tracing compressed content back to sources:

**Inline citation references** ([1], [2]) provide the lightest-weight provenance. Minimal tokens, requires maintaining a sources table. Scales well and survives multiple compression rounds as long as reference numbers remain consistent (HIGH — universal practice).

**Traceable text** attaches phrase-level provenance links from generated spans to source spans [18]. More granular but substantially increases document size. Readers answered questions more quickly and accurately with fine-grained links, especially when hallucinations were present (MODERATE — T3 source, 403 access on paper).

**Restorable compression** (Manus approach): strip information that exists in the environment, preserving only the reference needed to re-fetch it [11]. A URL replaces page content; a file path replaces file contents. High compression while maintaining provenance as pointers (MODERATE — T4 source, single implementation).

Key principle: provenance is metadata about compressed content, not part of the content itself. It uses a separate channel (sources table, footnotes, external links) that does not consume the same token budget as substance.

### Agent-Facing Document Constraints

LLM agents consume documents differently than humans:

**Positional attention bias** (lost-in-the-middle): performance drops >30% when relevant information sits in mid-context rather than at beginning or end [7]. Follows a U-shaped curve analogous to the serial-position effect in psychology. Documents must front-load key findings and restate takeaways at the end (HIGH — T3 source, peer-reviewed).

**Context rot**: performance degrades as input length increases, even when context window is not full. Chroma's 2025 research confirmed all 18 tested frontier models exhibit this. Shorter documents perform better — compression is quality improvement, not just cost reduction (MODERATE — multiple confirming sources).

**Structured sections improve retention**: content organized into clearly delineated sections with headers acts as retrieval anchors [10][15]. Structure forces the summarizer to populate each section, preventing silent information drift. Anthropic recommends XML tagging or Markdown headers [10] (HIGH — T1 source).

**Minimalism with sufficiency**: strive for the minimal set of information that fully outlines expected behavior [10]. Minimal does not mean short — sufficient information must be provided up front. Every token beyond sufficiency degrades performance through context rot (MODERATE — T1 source).

**Automated compression benchmarks**: LLMLingua achieves 20x compression with 1.5% performance loss [13]. LongLLMLingua boosts performance 21.4% with 4x fewer tokens [14]. ACON lowers memory usage 26-54% while maintaining task performance [20]. Substantial compression is achievable without meaningful quality loss when done systematically (HIGH — T3 sources, peer-reviewed).

### The Compression-Fidelity Tradeoff

Factory.ai's empirical benchmark across 36,000+ messages [8]:

- OpenAI: 99.3% compression, 3.35 quality score
- Anthropic: 98.7% compression, 3.44 quality score
- Factory: 98.6% compression, 3.70 quality score

Small differences in retained tokens (0.7%) yield measurable quality improvements (0.35 points). Structured summarization — with sections for intent, artifacts, decisions, and next steps — outperforms both opaque and regenerative approaches [8][9] (MODERATE — single comparative study, self-benchmarking).

**When compression destroys actionability**: cutting too aggressively forces re-fetching, adding latency and inference calls that outweigh token savings [9]. If an agent frequently re-reads files or re-fetches URLs after compression, the threshold is too aggressive (MODERATE — T4 source).

**Counter-evidence**: Judgment about relevance requires understanding the downstream task. The information bottleneck assumes you know the relevant variable Y, but research documents serve multiple potential downstream uses, making optimal compression unknowable in advance. This argues for conservative compression with structural provenance markers enabling later re-expansion.

## Challenge

### Assumptions Check

| Assumption | Supporting Evidence | Counter-Evidence | Impact if False |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Information theory frameworks apply meaningfully to natural language knowledge compression | Rate-distortion is the established framework for lossy compression [1]; IB explicitly models preserving "relevant information" [2][5]; semantic extensions exist [19] | Shannon excluded semantics [19]; natural language meaning resists statistical capture; theories operate on signals, not structured knowledge | HIGH — theoretical grounding collapses to purely heuristic advice |
| Lost-in-the-middle makes document structure a first-order concern | Liu et al. found >30% performance drop [7]; MIT 2025 identified architectural causes; U-shaped curve well-documented | Models improving; calibration may fix it; negligible for short documents (<1000 tokens) | MODERATE — magnitude depends on document length and model |
| Structured summarization preserves more useful information than opaque compression | Factory.ai: 3.70 vs 3.35 [8]; COMPRESSION.md designed around this [15]; Manus uses schema-based summarization [11] | Factory's self-benchmarking; probe evaluation may miss dimensions; opaque achieves higher compression (99.3%) | MODERATE — single biased study, but mechanism is logically sound |
| Provenance can be preserved at acceptable cost | Traceable text provides phrase-level links [18]; extractive methods preserve directly; hybrid approaches exist | Provenance metadata increases size; citation chains compound errors across rounds; abstractive attribution is "daunting" | MODERATE — achievable but limits compression ratios |

### Premortem

| Failure Reason | Plausibility | Impact on Conclusion |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Information theory framing is a false analogy: rate-distortion and IB operate on statistical signals, not structured semantic knowledge. "Compress while preserving what matters" is obvious advice dressed in mathematics. | Medium | Theoretical foundations are analogical, not prescriptive. Practical heuristics remain valid. |
| Agent architectures evolve faster than compression strategies. Better mid-context attention and larger effective windows may obsolete current heuristics within 1-2 years. | Medium | Frame recommendations as current best practices, not permanent constraints. |
| The real bottleneck is judgment: knowing what is relevant requires understanding the downstream task. The information bottleneck's "relevant variable Y" assumes you know Y. | High | Strengthens task-dependency finding. Any system must define distortion relative to use cases. |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Define your distortion measure first.** Before compressing, decide what constitutes acceptable loss for the specific downstream use. The information bottleneck's key insight — compress relative to a purpose — is the single most important principle.

2. **Use structure to force preservation.** Dedicated sections for decisions, constraints, findings, sources, and limitations act as checklists. The compressor must populate each section, preventing silent information drift. This is why structured summarization outperforms opaque compression.

3. **Separate provenance from content.** Citation numbers, source tables, and file path references add minimal tokens while maintaining traceability. Provenance travels in a separate channel from substance.

4. **Front-load and back-load key information.** The lost-in-the-middle effect is real and architectural. Put key findings in the summary (top) and takeaways (bottom). Detail goes in the middle where attention is weakest.

5. **Compress aggressively but reversibly.** Strip information that exists in the environment (file contents, URL payloads) and preserve only the pointer needed to re-fetch. This achieves high compression while keeping recovery paths open.

6. **Apply progressive layers.** Raw research (Layer 1) becomes bolded key phrases (Layer 2) becomes highlighted essentials (Layer 3) becomes executive summary (Layer 4). Each layer leaves behind good-but-not-great content.

7. **Specific facts resist compression.** Names, dates, exact figures, file paths, and identifiers are incompressible (Kolmogorov complexity). Patterns and generalizations compress well. A good distillation preserves the specific and compresses the general.

## Limitations and Follow-ups

- Factory.ai's compression benchmark is the only comparative empirical study found; more independent evaluation is needed
- The information theory framing is analogical — these frameworks provide vocabulary and mental models, not precise bounds for natural language
- Agent architecture improvements may reduce the importance of lost-in-the-middle within 1-2 years
- No research was found on provenance degradation across multiple rounds of compression (compression of compressed summaries)
- The "research debt" problem (Topos Institute) — distillation not keeping pace with publication — remains unsolved at scale
