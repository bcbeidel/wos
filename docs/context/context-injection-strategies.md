Instruction files are table stakes — every AI coding tool has them. The competitive differentiation is in how tools automatically discover and inject relevant context beyond those static files. Four fundamentally different strategies have emerged, each reflecting a distinct architectural philosophy.

## The Four Approaches

### 1. AST-Based Repo Maps (Aider)

Aider uses tree-sitter AST analysis to build a graph of the entire codebase, ranking files by relevance using a PageRank-like algorithm. The result is a compact "repo map" showing the most important classes, functions, and their call relationships. This approach requires no manual file selection — the tool automatically surfaces the code most relevant to the current task.

**Tradeoff:** High automation, strong code understanding, but computationally expensive and language-dependent. Works best when the task involves existing code relationships rather than new greenfield work.

### 2. Flow-Based Tracking (Windsurf)

Windsurf's Cascade tracks edits, terminal commands, and navigation patterns in real-time, maintaining "deep awareness" of development patterns over time. It automatically generates persistent Memories from observed patterns, building an evolving model of how the developer works.

**Tradeoff:** Rich temporal context that improves over time, but requires continuous IDE integration. The context is session-dependent and developer-specific — it captures how you work, not just what the code does.

### 3. Indexed Retrieval (Cursor)

Cursor indexes the full codebase and uses semantic search to pull relevant code into context. This is combined with explicit `@file` and `@folder` references that give users direct control. The indexed approach means any file in the repo is discoverable without pre-selection.

**Tradeoff:** Fast retrieval over large codebases, but the quality depends on embedding and ranking quality. Semantic search can miss relevant code that uses different terminology from the query.

### 4. On-Demand Tool-Based Reading (Claude Code)

Claude Code reads files as needed during task execution using tool calls to search, read, and navigate. Skills and `CLAUDE.md` provide static context; dynamic context is assembled through active exploration. Supports up to 10 concurrent subagents, each with 200K token context.

**Tradeoff:** Maximum flexibility — the agent decides what to read based on the actual task. But it consumes tokens for exploration and may miss relevant files it doesn't know to look for. The quality depends on the agent's search strategy.

## Architectural Incompatibility

These approaches are not converging because they make fundamentally different architectural bets:

- **Pre-computed vs. on-demand.** Aider and Cursor pre-analyze the codebase; Claude Code and Windsurf build context at task time.
- **Code-centric vs. behavior-centric.** Aider and Cursor focus on code structure; Windsurf focuses on developer behavior patterns.
- **Static vs. dynamic.** Repo maps and indexes are built ahead of time; tool-based reading and flow tracking are inherently dynamic.

This means there is no "best" approach — the right strategy depends on the interaction model. Tools that run in IDEs with persistent sessions (Windsurf, Cursor) can amortize indexing and tracking costs. Tools that run in terminals or CI (Claude Code, Aider) need strategies that work without persistent state.

## Implications for Context Engineering

For teams providing context to AI tools, the strategy divergence means:

1. **Static context matters most for on-demand tools.** Claude Code benefits most from well-structured `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` files because it relies on them for initial orientation before exploring.
2. **File organization matters for indexed tools.** Cursor and Aider reward clean, well-named files because their discovery algorithms use file names and structure as signals.
3. **Behavioral consistency matters for flow tools.** Windsurf builds better context when development patterns are consistent and predictable.

The safest bet is investing in structured, well-organized project context that works across all strategies — which is what WOS provides.
