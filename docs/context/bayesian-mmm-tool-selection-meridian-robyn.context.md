Google open-sourced Meridian on January 29, 2025, making it the canonical replacement for LightweightMMM, which is no longer supported. Any organization using LightweightMMM should treat it as deprecated. The choice between Meridian and Robyn is not primarily a statistical choice — both are capable — but a team capability and infrastructure choice.

Meridian is built on Bayesian causal inference using TensorFlow Probability and XLA compilers. Its distinguishing architectural feature is hierarchical geo-level modeling: it supports 50+ geographic regions, yields tighter ROI credible intervals than national-level models, and produces probability distributions across all parameters rather than point estimates. Hill functions capture saturation; geometric and binomial adstock functions capture carryover. GPU acceleration via Google Colab Pro+ is recommended for performance. Calibration uses complementary geo-experiment tools (GeoX, trimmed_match, matched_markets). Meridian requires a strong data science background and is better suited for organizations with dedicated data teams. The implementation requires 2-3 years of weekly geographic data.

Robyn, maintained by Meta, implements MMM using ridge regression rather than Bayesian inference. Ridge regression addresses multicollinearity and prevents overfitting — a real problem in MMM given the high correlation between marketing channels over time. Its defining differentiator is multi-objective optimization via Nevergrad: rather than selecting a single "best" model, it generates a Pareto frontier of model options balancing prediction error (NRMSE) and business fit (DECOMP.RSSD). Analysts must apply business judgment to select from the Pareto front. Robyn is R-native with a more approachable interface and is designed for smaller teams without extensive statistical infrastructure. Experimental calibration via conversion lift tests and GeoLift is recommended to validate coefficients.

Four open-source MMM tools are in active use: Robyn (Meta, Ridge regression, R), Meridian (Google, Bayesian, Python), PyMC-Marketing (Bayesian, Python, community-maintained), and Orbit (Uber, time-series Stan). Managed platforms — Funnel, Recast, Haus — abstract the infrastructure but add ongoing cost. The tool choice matters far less than the data readiness. According to Funnel.io's practitioner analysis, the model itself is only 20% of the work; the other 80% is consolidating and transforming data. ETL pipeline reliability becomes the primary bottleneck. Teams need proficiency in either R or Python plus deep knowledge of data science, statistics, and engineering to build and maintain these systems.

The practical guidance: choose Meridian if you have an enterprise data science team, need geo-level granularity, and want native integration with Google's geo-experiment calibration tools. Choose Robyn if you have an R-proficient analyst team, value interpretable Pareto-fronted model selection, and need faster time-to-first-model. In either case, resolve data infrastructure — clean, consistent, multi-year channel-level spend and outcome data — before selecting a tool. Without reliable data inputs, tool sophistication is irrelevant. Budget at least 80% of implementation effort for data pipeline work, not model development.
